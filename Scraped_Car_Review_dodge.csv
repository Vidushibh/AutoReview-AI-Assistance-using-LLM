Havent repaired anything or replaced anything but tires and normal maintenance items. Upgraded tires to Michelin LX series helped fuel economy. Would buy another in a second",4.625
 on 07/17/05 21:59 PM (PDT),Mark ,2002 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 3500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),Disappointmnet," Bought this car as a commuter vehicle for a van pool.  I was very disappointed in the vehicle in comparison to a 1997 model I had previously.  The motor was sluggish and tended to have a rough idle.  The A/C was better than the old van, but still lacked a separate control for the front and back.  What I was most disappointed with was that in moving up five years, I lost driver room, the ability to adjust the steering wheel to where I like it, and the passenger seats, by all accounts were less comfortable.  What I noticed in driving is that the vehicle had a very large turning radius.  Very difficult to maneuver in traffic.",2.125

 on 02/09/05 18:52 PM (PST),VanMan ,2001 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),Not what Dodge used to be," Good solid frame and suspension.  Well equipped, full power.  Gauges and controls are well designed and located.  Nice to drive once you are up and in.  No leg room on passenger side.  318 engine seems very weak and some spark plugs are very hard to access.  Terrible gas mileage (avg 12MPG).  Sheet metal is flimsy and dents if you lean against it or bump it.  Paint chips and scratches very easily.  Sliding side door jumped the track and scraped the whole side of the van.  Rear door caught in wind and pulled bolts out of frame.  Three front windshields in three years (stress point in center?).  No mechanical problems with drive train.  Reliable.  Still not the quality my older Dodge vans had.",2.875

 on 08/01/17 16:40 PM (PDT),Guy ,2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 2500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),Failur is lurking in every corner," Purchased the vehicle in 2003 second hand with 15000 miles from the owner (a one driver operator, not rental). This review was written in 2017 with only 110000 miles on it! It has been a great service van for my business but not without flaws. After warranty expired problems begin. Had to replace computer controller few times. Fuel hose went bad, chair adjustment lever broke, minor repairs here and there, water pump replaced, temperature control unit replaced, gas tank and pump replaced. Using a very accurate repair expenses controlled by business analysis I can say that the average repair cost is around $600 per year. This vehicle can't go farther than 10 trips without me worrying when would be the next problem. Dealer sticker say 12/15 miles per gallon but with very conservative driving my records show 17 miles per gallon. Overall I don't think it's the best value for vehicle but being optimistic as I am it is not the worst either. Hope this helps.",3
 on 02/25/06 06:09 AM (PST),smithtp ,2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Ext Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),Great Van," Bought used with 34k,the conversion package by Elk automotive is top rate. Has leather, cd, dvd, rear air, tv, rear stereo, all the goodies. Very easy to drive despite its size, ride is nice and quiet inside. With the 318 engines and regular service these things are allmost bullet-proof. As most manufacturers produce very few of the large van conversions any more and the new ones costing 50k that are available, I feel that for 20k I stole this thing. One of the best things is it's still under warranty with Chryslers 7/70 plan. These are the only way to travel, if you are buying for everyday use, it's probably not the right vehicle. ",4.625

As always, I performed a full vehicle check on the car before purchasing it. I loved this car, it was fast fun, elegant, and provided everything I needed, at first. Since I bought it I have had numerous mechanical, programing, and electrical issues currently totaling to $4,500 dollars. Just to give an idea, at 70,000 miles my throttle just went out (this isn't included in what I have already spent) and I now have to replace the entire intake system which is going to cost around $2,200 (these costs don't include mechanics fees, which will potentially double the costs) *A battery cost $300 ",3.625

I like to be able to load stuff the flea market and go fishing so I went with the wagon. It was like driving a SUV, and the speed!!! I had to check myself a few times, but this is the most powerful car I ever had. I drove a Nissan Altima for 2 years and this is a whole new class of car. Stylish, fast, a real head turner. It had over 80,000 miles, but you can't tell by the way it rides and excels on the road. So far so good, it seem to be a well build wagon with AWD for the snow, glad that I got this.... ",5

Wheels started to corrode, transmission leaked, windshield wiper controls had to be replaced (all fixed under warranty). Had to replace factory tires at 31,000 miles, replaced a tie-rod at about 40,000 miles, and the brake rotors warped. Wiper controls were again acting up, and a noise started in the front suspension when I finally decided to trade it off. Loved the power and looks, but it had to go. Build and component quality was awful. This car turned me off of Dodge products.",3.75

Perfectly engineered, meticulously designed. Simply perfect. It's time for Toyota to stop relentlessly pursuing perfection. Because Dodge got there first with the magnum rt. The power is unbelievable. Handling outstanding. And comfort is second to none. I've been a mustang owner and lover for the past 15 years. But now, after driving this magnum hemi for less than a week, I'm in love with it. With 82k miles it feels as if it just rolled off the assembly line and into my garage. Simply amazing automobile.

And, it drives like it, too - not exactly ""agile."" I would have never payed $35,000 for a new one, but for $13,000 w/65,000 miles I think it was a steal, and it's one of the coolest looking cars ever. Doesn't feel as fast as you might think it would, and gas mileage still not good even w/cylinder management. But, every time I look at it or smash the gas, it makes me smile. Oh, and it'll hold quite a bit of crap, too.",4.375

My magnum is a car with the space of a SUV. It has the small V6 so the gas mileage is not all that bad. I would of never got a SUV with 51,000 miles for the great price I paid for my car.

 on 04/29/10 07:49 AM (PDT),knowles ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),2006 SE 2.7," Love the style. Mine has color matched 22"" chrome wheels...had a side wall puncture. Can't replace just one tire and had to go to several places to find a good tire in stock since I did not want to wait to order tires. Cost for 2 was pricey but that has nothing to do with the car. Also, to anyone thinking about beefing up the look with big tires and rims, okay for around town but you lose some of the quality in the ride. Have tried to figure out why but no one can give me an answer. Non the less, with the color coordinated rims (car is metallic red) it's an eye catcher. No mechanical problems. It's a 2006 SE 2.7 with 40,000. I wasn't looking to win a race and don't want a gas hog.",4.75

I have hauled my 20' extension ladder and  wheelbarrow in the back with the seats folded down. More than enough room for the dog. Had to replace both outer tie rods(under warranty) and o2 sensor (warranty ran out) but still happy with the vehicle. Will add roof rack.Great in the snow with snow tires as I have owned 4 wheel drive and AWD before.Got to have it here in this area. Have to wait and see how it holds up but so far so good.",4.375
 on 06/21/09 19:53 PM (PDT),Greg L. ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),Fun & quality," This is a very large car that handles like a sports car.  Corners flat, breaks straight, very comfortable ride and considering the too small engine, it has good acceleration.  It does NOT like to pull a trailer, but if you're reasonable it's okay with that too. The drivers seat is far too narrow, I'm a big guy and have to find just the right spot to get comfortable.  Some people don't like the sparten interior, but I like the design.  However, a little less of a plastic look would be nice.   The exterior design is outstanding and there are lots of storage pockets and nooks and crannies.  The standard tires are just adequate, but in Canada you really do need snow tires for winter safety.",4.5

 on 01/07/09 12:55 PM (PST),baycity ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Awesome," I traded in my 3rd Yukon Denali 3 years ago for this car and I love it. I didn't need a big SUV, but I still needed the use of a utility vehicle for my business, kids and dogs. This car is great.  I average 20mpg with the 5.7 Hemi.  I can have my cake and eat it too.  I leased the car back in 2006 and just thought I would lease or buy another car when my time was up, but Chrysler sent me an offer I couldn't refuse. If I buy the car at the end of the lease, Chrysler will take a substantial amount off the residual buyout amount in the contract, so Iv'e decided to buy the car. 3 years and 57K miles later I haven't had any problems except with the navi which is a minor repair hopefully.",4.875
 on 01/03/09 19:17 PM (PST),firetech ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),One of the best cars I've ever had," I needed to replace my aging and worn out Volvo 850 wagon. We are a family of 5 including two teenagers, one who is 6 feet tall. I needed a roomy car, that actually had legroom in the rear seat for my son. Short of buying a limo the Dodge LX cars are one of the only ones that fit the bill. I also wanted power and safety in the way of front and side air bags, trac control etc, etc. This car has it all in spades. I set out to but the 6cyl SXT but couldn't pass up the R/T when it crossed my tracks. If you are sensible on the throttle the R/T's fuel mileage is almost as good as the 3.5 SXT. My advice is if you have a choice, buy the R/T with the 5.7, it's way more fun and still decent on fuel.",4.75

It now has nearly 81k miles.  Overall, it's been very reliable...roomy, comfortable, fast, no rattles, and decent gas mileage (22 mpg avg. in mixed highway and city gridlock). The RWD has only been a problem once, in a very heavy snow. The front brake rotors were replaced at 38k, and will need to be replaced again soon.  The original tires lasted to 71k. At approx. 75k, a rocker arm broke, a $500 fix.  The mechanic says it's common, but not frequent, on the 3.5 liter motor.  Other than that, just oil changes and tire rotation.  I love the styling of the car, too bad it's been discontinued.  Everyone who rides in it loves it!",4.625

This car is a great driving car and we get 24MPG overall with the 2.7 liter engine.  Mileage is very comparable to the many small SUVs we were looking at before we decided to buy our Magnum.  The 2.7L engine is lively and responsive and we've experienced no problems mechanically.,4.125

It corners flat and holds the road beautifully.  The 2.7 Liter engine is a little underpowered for the size of the vehicle, but considering it is such a small engine, I have no problem with available power.  I purchased the 2.7 specifically because I wanted a vehicle that affords good fuel economy, and it delivers that plus I like driving the Magnum.  I purchased the car in 2008 and am very happy with the value received.  I get a car that looks and feels like a new car and the 2 years depreciation (60% off new price) give me a real bargain.  I don't understand it but like getting such a great bargain!",4.625
 on 04/05/08 23:06 PM (PDT),ACM ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Fun and flexible.," I went from a 2006 Honda Odyssey (3 steering racks in 20,000 miles was 3 too many) to the RT. The cargo volume is not quite that of the van but it is good. Four guys and golf bags are handled with ease. The gas mileage to date (5500 miles) is one mile to the gallon worse than the Honda. The fun to drive factor is approximately 8.5 out of 10. If you have to drive a wagon this is the one that will make you smile. I can only imagine how much fun the SRT8 must be to drive. I am already planning some tweaks to the engine and suspension because the chassis is just so good that it begs for more power and better spring rates. This really is a great platform, hats off to the engineers at Dodge",4.125

Even though I did not get the AWD, it still rocks in any weather, with the addition of Blizzaks for the winter. I'm 6'4"" and it is really comfortable, plus with two car seats in the back, the kids have enough room too. I put the whole family in and we go looking fo twisty turny roads to play on.  With the autostick, I can run that car pretty hard and it just keeps asking for more.  Cruises really nicely for the 25 mile each way commute, but gotta keep an eye on it.

I was statisfied with the price, leather , styling, sunroof, and the space. Hope it would be as powerful as my 1970 Cutlass which I missed dearly, and holy cow it was. Not only was it peppy and powerful but I had all the safety and comfort of a car built today. And yes, it does get good gas mileage when driven nicely, which I personally cannot do!

So I bought a 2006 SRT8 w/ the 6.1 L Hemi. Wow! It's balck just like the one before and a whole lot faster. The power is almost unbelivable between the two.

I have not taken it on any long trips so I don't know the highway mpg.

Simply loved it but eventually sold it to a friend's son who kept bugging me for it (for 3 years).  After that I owned 2 Chargers, 1 R/T, 1 SRT and a Chrysler 300C.  I really missed  the wagon because of the versatility and nasty looks so when I was able to find the second wagon I grabbed it. Never have had any issues with any of these vehicles but then I take care of all the maintenance/repair myself so no one can mess them up. There is a HUGE difference between the 5.7 and 6.1 Hemi LX cars pretty much in all respects so for me it will always be the SRT. The 6.1 responds very well to small changes (tuning,exhaust,CAI) and kicks real butt when you also loose 150-200 lbs of weight from the car which is not that hard to do. Even with the 12 sec. 1/4 mile performance I get around 23mpg on 75mph trips. Best of both worlds and the darn thing is a wagon to boot! Kudo's to the SRT team.  This gang has brought back the old day attitude and swagger we had in the 60's and early 70's.

The car is a natural street ""looker"" and is well liked by ""car people"". The Red Pearl color is perfect and reinforces the design and general performance stance.

My SRT Magnum came with GPS, Sirius Satelite Radio, all leather interior, (Gray on Black-Standard for SRT8) steering wheel remotes, sunroof and digital gauges with white face gauges. The new Hemi 6.1 liter is just as appealing to look at as the rest of the car. I do feel that the exhuast could have been a bit throatier, however you do hear the engine well at 6000 rpms.

This one simply flies. The whole car has been upgraded from the suspension to the transmission to the brakes. It feels like a complete package. Handles suprisingly well for a 4300lb car. Seats are terrific, way better that the stock RT seats.  Driving the car is an exercise in right foot restraint. The barritone soundtrack that comes with a quick jab of the throttle is worth the price of admission alone. The thrust that comes with this right foot exercise is very impressive indeed.

If you crave attention buy another car- although this car gets a knowing glance from anyone who understands Dodge's secret society.

Second, after numerous visits to the dealer, about intermittent problems with the rear power windows, the window regulator seized up. Just outside of the warranty. (what a coincidence, and I have the other side to look forward to repairing now) The engine has been running rough for the last 27,000 miles and, of course, the dealer has been unable to diagnose or fix.

Stiff steering and rapid wear went away. Reset toe in with homemade toe jig. One alignment garage refused to try to align van at 50K due to ball joints wear and tie rods loose. Now at 131K steering still tight and using Molylithium grease for ball joints. Four speed heater fan failed at 110K-replaced for $25 using my screw driver. Winter of 2015 Chicago and motor hard to start and not hitting on all cylinders when cold. Checked internet with symptoms and glow plugs-5 Beru-MB brand were questionable. Found electrical resistance on 3 of 5 plugs to be incorrect. Bought deep metric socket at HomeDepot for $4. and removed 3 glow plugs with new Bosch NAPA plugs for $22 each. Not all 5 needed replacing according to testing resistance readings. Van starts at 22 below zero F with no problems using Peak anti gel 1 oz/5 gallons. I replace fuel filters and oil change with Shell T-6 5W40 every 10K. Best mileage on highway before the camber wedge was 34mpg. loaded coming back from St. Louis. After correcting the camber, going to Twin Cities MN, mpg was 36-37 driving at 63-65mph, small load with very little wind. This van does not use oil and I let it warm up to the first temperature gage mark before driving away. I will drive around the block and let it warm up even more if I immediately do highway driving. A neighbor with the longer WB 2500 '06 drove it like a Ford V-8 and blew up the turbo and then the cylinder head gasket, rear axle seal, and a host of other extended warranty items. Heavy foot driver. My van driving in the Smokey Mts and Blue Ridge Mts. with the turbo and that car like handling: I was passing other cars going up and down the long runs and curves. Reminded me of my early 180D's. I change the rear end fluids every 50K and repack the front wheel bearings every 40-50K depending on the noise I hear--set them loose and use Molylith grease. Oil the doors once a month. I installed a 2 place rear seat from a 2004 Sprinter and now can take the kids with me. Or maybe a mother-in-law. Replaced rear doors step plate for $70. This van will probably outlast me. Letting the motor warm up is the secret: don't tell anyone Sheeeee  Oh, I do woodworking and extend the bulk head back 2"" for increased leg room and seat tilt"" helps on short or long drive and wife likes the more seat tilt. Replaced MAF due to uneven performance and MPG went up along with adding a rear Kamm style airfoil that is effective from 45mph on up. The airfoil makes head winds more sensitive due to reduced drag at the rear. Added new rear shocks due to total collapse of the original shocks. The shocks and airfoil make highway driving much more stable especially in lane changes and curves. No oil consumption at this time.Update at 150K. I had been out of comish for 5 months due to a bad case of Shingles. Still suffering but datz life. The air foil attached to rear-Kamm style gets me into the upper 30's mpg and takes over at 45 mph. Made of wood with membrane press. Replaced front rotors with Premium NAPA but they not good metal. replaced rear rotors due to build up of crap on sides due to road slush, I guess. Went with $10 more for MB quality and van stops on a quarter. All is well with this van and expect to go another 300K miles if no body shops are involved.? Got a memo from MBenz asking me to have the computer recalibrated due to that year not notifying owner of EGR failure and other MAF failure with not trouble codes. This sounds like a MB-VW spoof and I will not let those boys touch the van to change it. And, now I hear that MB will not be importing Diesel cars any more.? Something sounds off in that request. Will change the rear diff fluid in the Spring '18 and replace front wheel bearings at that time due to some sounds like the announcers make before that prize fights, ""rumble rumble"". I may start looking for another '06 Sprinter and keep it in the back 40. Rust on the later models of V-6 Sprinters in Chicago is a problem on the side-low.  All for now in Feb of '18.",5

You'll love it.," Bought this vehicle to convert into a wheelchair accessible vehicle.  The lift dealer said their lift wouldn't work in this van, but our provider custom fitted a swing in lift.  With 5'9"" stock headroom in the passenger compartment, it's almost purpose built for our requirements.  It handles pretty much like a car, is very comfortable to drive for long distances, and I can parallel park it on the first go with the parking sensors and big side mirrors.  My biggest beef with it is the environmental controls.  I've had the van for almost two years, and I still haven't got the big goofy knob figured out.

With the exception of the nice and high driving position, you would think that you are driving a minivan. It really is that easy and totally different from what you would expect from something that is 25 foot long (170"" EXT model). I was first concerned about the horsepower being so low, but the power is more than sufficient due to the torque and doesn't have any major issues keeping up with traffic. Highway mileage is phenomenal for such a large vehicle. 22-23 MPG is the norm on the highway and even better if drafting. Ride is also very comfortable.",4.75

 on 11/21/17 23:46 PM (PST),Bobby C. ,2005 Dodge Sprinter Van 2500 High Roof 158 WB 3dr Ext Van (2.7L 5cyl Turbodiesel 5A),Bought new- Owned 12+ years so far.," I bought my 2005 158"" tall cargo van brand new for recreational use: long distance enroute camping, towing small travel trailer, utility use for cargo and building materials. After owning it 12 1/2 years I can't imagine getting rid of it ever. Great MPG at 25-27, even when loaded with 1500 pounds in the back. Tows 3500 pounds with ease. Performance is adequate if you don't activate the turbo, but open it up (I've only done it a few times) and it's downright QUICK. I baby the vehicle big-time, and it's never let me down mechanically. When loaded or towing I use a complete electronic gauge package (""Edge"") and I VERY carefully monitor and regulate the EGT, manifold pressure, and fuel rail pressures using speed control, gear selection, and throttle position. I did have a 150a alternator regulator fail at 60k miles, but other than that no problems unless you count the auxiliary diesel fuel powered hydronic block heater that quit after only 6 uses or so. The transmission works fine, but makes noises like driving over a highway rumble strip at times. Was like this when I picked up the van w/ 12mi on the odometer, and it still does it. Mercedes says ""they all do it"" and that it's not a defect. Also fuel lines vibrate at certain throttle settings and RPM, but again, it hasn't gotten worse. The original tires have legal tread at over 100,000mi. The brakes make the vehicle shake like it's falling apart when towing long downhills, but when empty, no vibration. I installed new drilled, slotted rotors and super heavy duty pads thinking it was hot brakes, but there was no change. Again, ""they all do it,"" though no one knows why. The rotors are NOT warped, and at 50,000mi the fronts still had zero run-out, no wear ridge, and the pads were only 30% worn. The ride is not great empty or full compared to my former E-350 Econoline diesel van, but it's acceptable. The heater and A/C are useless in hot or cold climates unless you install a barrier behind the front seats, even with a super-insulated cabin (I installed 1"" rigid foam on ever sq inch of the cargo compartment walls and ceiling, AND installed paneling on the walls, and also MB super-insulated passenger van ceilings on the roof for extra insulation, and curtains on ALL back windows, and still the HVAC is a bad joke w/o the divider curtain I made from clear shower curtain material that snaps tightly in around the whole fuselage right behind the front seats. The van will swallow ANYTHING you want to put in it (13ft behind the front seats, and you can carry 16ft lumber down-the-center if you want), I've kept my van garaged or in a car port, but those kept outside tend to rust on the top because of poor paintwork. I bought mine in arctic white to prolong the paint life (dark colors self-destruct in direct sunlight), and it still looks almost new. If you owned and drove air cooled VW Microbuses for many years like I did, this van will feel like the ""old days"" despite the van is a water cooled diesel up front. It sounds, feels, and handles about teh same, though a bit better in cross-winds. It's MUCH faster, and gives better MPG, of course.  Strangely, the engine has no oil pressure gauge or light, but only an oil low-quantity light, so theoretically an oil pressure problem could destroy the $12,000 engine without the slightest warning, which I find odd, but I spoke with FedEx fleet operators, and none said they ever had an engine failure, so maybe it's a moot point. FedEx gets about 140,000 out of the 5 spd auto transmissions, but they are not babied. I am hoping babying mine will better that figure.",5

She knows nothing about cars, so as long as it works, she won't care. So far, I haven't had any major issues with my car and I'm at 80K miles, but I still fear for my life. There was a recall on seatbelts and airbags. As long as you don't suck at driving though, you can survive. It gets great gas mileage! I started working in town and didn't have to commute, so I'm still at a full tank after filling up last week. But that's probably the only good thing about this car. This car has a 2.4 inline-4 engine, and the 3.6 V6 has 110 more horsepower but same mpg. This car is gutless. You press on the gas pedal and you almost hear the engine ask you to repeat yourself because it didn't hear you and then you find out your engine is a turtle crawling backwards in January. The 4 speed transmission is like an older gentleman, it's slow to decide on what it wants to do, even though you told it what to do a thousand times. I tried buying aftermarket parts to modify it's performance and literally the only thing anybody makes for it is a cold air intake. So you really won't get far with that idea. The exhaust is fairly loud, but only from inside the cab if that makes any sense. The radio at least works, it has a 6 disc CD player because we all need that, but at least it had an auxiliary port, but no Bluetooth or usb. The seats are pretty comfortable, but for about 2 hours. After that, your butt starts getting numb. After all the immediately important stuff, then you think about what to do when something needs repairs. Engine parts aren't too hard to find as long as it's a sensor. Anything else is special order from dealer or it doesn't exist. Changing out a simple battery requires the removal of the front left wheel and fender. Buying a new engine or transmission if necessary, is almost as much as the car is worth. That actually doesn't say much... Wheels are common though, brakes are easy to replace, oil changes are a breeze, but I got my hand stuck trying to change my headlights because I didn't like the idea of removing the bumper to get to it. Overall, this is one of those cars you only should drive as a rental or a lease when it had 30k miles on it. But after 100k, well I don't think I've ever seen one yet that isn't for sale.",2

The heater core and radiator were changed a few months after I bought it because the heater was blowing freezing cold air out of the passenger side. The repair shop told me it was because when they put the sealant on the car when it was built they used too much and it went into the radiator and through the cooling/heating system. Obviously that was not true and It is now again blowing freezing cold air on the passenger side. This is horrible. It is 5 degrees outside here and I cannot even get my car warm to get my son to school and me to work. This really needs to be addressed and fixed by DODGE, not the car owner. I have seen 100's of complaints on this issue with the same car. I am at a point where I really just want a different car because something keeps happening with this car. The electrical system had to be replaced due to faulty issues, wipers didn't work properly they would go on by themselves, then they would not work at all. In the winter time when I start the car it sounds like there is something screaming under the hood. There is a clicking noise in the car when it is hot outside and the repair shop cannot find anything wrong? The breaks had to be replaced right after I got the car because they squealed when in reverse. I had to take the car back a few weeks after they changed the breaks because of the squealing because guess what, they started squealing again. I was told it is normal because of the new break pads they use on Dodge vehicles. They said there is a coating on the pads that make them ALL squeal. That is NOT TRUE.",3

We bought brand new 65,000 mile ALL SEASO tires at Les Schwab. Well guess what ? It still did the same thing. We took it back to Les Schwab to have it checked out and was told there is nothing wrong with the tires and they have had MANY Dodge Avengers in because of the same problem.

There are a few things that needs to be address before the avenger can be a really neat ride.  The Heater core seems to be a major issue with this vehicle.  Especially if you live in cold areas.  The Heater only blows warm air on the driver side of the vehicle and cold air on the passenger side.  Dodge is well aware of this issue but has not done a recall on this placing the cost to repair this problem onto the consumer.  Even then there is no assurance this problem will not return since the problem is in the faulty part.  The cost can be anywhere from $900 to $1300 to repair depending on your area mechanics. Cold air in the winter renders this vehicle useless during the winter season.  My vehicle is currently parked now and I am seriously consider trading this vehicle in for another one.  Mostly because I refuse to pay to fix something that is flawed and Dodge knows that it is.  Making you feel like you purchased a lemon.  Not right Dodge, not right...I need a vehicle I can drive year round and not for 6 or 7 months out of the year.  In Kansas it has really cool down in the temps. So it's looking like this vehicle will be parked November- March, and that's if the weather is not crazy cold in March.  So with that said I encourage anyone having issues with their heating system in their dodge avenger to speak up and be heard.  Not sure what it will take to make Dodge do a recall on this issue.  For me, I'll be looking to trade this vehicle in if Dodge refuse to act by January.. Maybe someone in Florida or LA can use a ride that cools pretty well in the summer months, but they better not take a trip up North during the Fall.",2

I chose the bright silver exterior with black interior. It has nice quality materials andcraftsmanship. The 2.4 engine has all the power I need and gets great mpg. If you want to race once in a while get the v-6 version, it has over a hundred more horse power... be careful ""laughs"". I also like the way the avenger feels on the road...

Repair cost $1800. Overall the car is fun to drive, great on gas. I can spend $25 on gas and get any were from 250-300 miles on 1/2-3/4 tank of gas, or 7-9 gallons of the 12 gallon tank.",4.375

All of them are at least somewhat impressed with the car, but not as much as I am. This car is fun! Aside from being a real head turner, the acceleration is great! The turning radius is a sad joke, but I can live with that. Who would have thought that my 10 year old beauty could still give me over 30mpg and raise eyebrows at the same time. The only mechanical items I have had to address in 5 years were routine maint. and ball joint failure on the passenger side. This was at least a recall item though and I hope to be reimbursed by Dodge shortly.  She's a great car still!",4.5

 on 08/19/06 07:58 AM (PDT),JPRacer ,1997 Dodge Avenger Coupe ES 2dr Coupe,The Mitsubishi Camaro," In the three years I have driven it, the Avenger is an overall excellent car. Exterior styling is second only to the Viper. Handling exceeds the power for a stiff, yet solidly comfortable ride. Interior space is engineered to the max for functionality and comfort with basic, well-placed controls and ample trunk space. The 163HP V-6 is brisk, yet not overpowering and has had no real problems at all for 80,000+ miles. Performs at the fun-to-drive level and accessories are pleasing. Fuel mileage is decent, but could be better. It's a unique auto and turns heads wherever I go. Definitely a great car if taken care of properly. I will keep mine as long as I can.",4.625

My first experience as a Dodge owner was with a 1996 Intrepid that my wife thought looked pretty nice and said I should try it out. It had 45,000 miles when I purchased it and I drove it for the next twelve years and when I finally gave it up it had 325,000 miles on it. Naturally I was drawn to the Dodge brand and the Avenger was a sporty looking car and I needed something to teach my daughter how to drive in. My other kids got to drive the Intrepid. I really wanted the Charger, but opted for the smaller sized car. Still not a bad choice. I opted for the 3.6L V6 engine since that was what my Intrepid had in it and have never been disappointed. the only problem I have encountered was when the car was about three months old, the transmission seemed to lock up one time as I was rolling to a stop sign. I couldn't get it to go into gear, but after towing it to the dealer and having them check it out, they found nothing and it never happened again. I now have almost 100,000 miles, I drive it a lot, have been through two sets of tires, change my own oil every 5,000 miles religiously and keep it a clean as I can living in North East Ohio. It's a blast to drive on the twisting up and down roads even in the snow. One of my co-workers drives a Subaru and he couldn't keep up with me one night. Sometimes you get bad cars, sometimes you get good cars. I work in the Auto industry and all the parts come from the same bin no matter who buys them.

This is the worst new car I have ever owned and one of the worst overall cars I have ever owned.It overheated within 5,000 miles of ownership.  An orange grime appeared in the overflow tank and when I took it to the dealership they told me they had seen it numerous times and it was casting material that had not been completely flushed from the system at the factory.  The cruise control would refuse to turn on at times and the dealership could never reproduce it so it never was repaired.  It just became an issue I had to “live with”.  Fit and finish is mediocre at best.  The plastic surrounding the radio and middle vents in the dash never matched and again, the dealership stated replacing it wouldn’t change the gaps or the poor fit. The car had a surge from the day I bought it.  It also would start up and surge after a cold start, as if it were running too lean.  After three new releases of programing for the engine management computer the surge was still there.  It would surge at 25-35 mph and at 60ish mph. For 178 horse power this car has undesirable and inexcusable torque steer.  Leave a light from a stop and the car will pull hard right.  Leave the light under hard acceleration and if you don’t have ahold of the wheel you will do an un-commanded lane change in short order.The transmission never shifted smoothly.  Going uphill it would hunt for a gear.  Each time the transmission changes gears the torque steer pulls on the steering so going up a hill you are constantly correcting.The airbag warning light went off at 50,000 miles.  Source was a terrible design by Dodge.  There is a bungee cord pulling down on the wire bundle that leads to the headrest airbags.  Place a 220 pound man in the driver’s seat with this bungee cord pulling on the wires and you get broken wires.  Doesn’t take an engineer to figure that one out.Overall – Poor design, poor build quality, poor economy, horrible dealer support (or lack thereof) and a car that appears to be built to die in 5 years or less.*UPDATE* Chrysler has stopped production on the Dart, 200 and Avenger.  These platforms were substandard compared with others in the same class.  Since I created this review; I have traded the Avenger for a Nissan Altima.

A few months ago my brakes completely locked up and I couldn't even move my car. Cost my almost $1,000 to get it fixed. Now not even 3 months later my brakes are squeaking again. Terrible on brakes! Also a current issue.. I don't know if it's the transmission or what, but the entire car feels like it's vibrating and the steering wheel is especially wobbley. I hate it. It's so annoying! I will be trading this car in as soon as I can afford to and I will advise everyone who is looking for a new car not to purchase a Dodge Avenger. Terrible car!",1

I did look at a few other cars but was able to get this one in my price with the v6 vs others that only had a 4 cylinder. The v6 is nice and much better than the 4 cylinder in the avenger.  I also did not give up much in MPG vs the 4.  The ride is not bad at all and the seat are just find for my wife and I. MY son likes the pull down cup holders in the back seat. The Avenger is only a little smaller than some of the cars in its class but it's because of this that I liked it. It makes it much easier in parking lots and tight spaces. Be careful backing up because of the blind spot which is bigger than most cars. Overall I really enjoy this car.,4.75

The 2.4 has adequate power for the average person but for the young at heart, the 3.6L has more than enough power for theamateur road racer.

 on 02/25/18 09:43 AM (PST),Dean K ,2008 Dodge Avenger Sedan R/T 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Ol'Reliable!," Hi, We bought this car new in Dallas off the showroom floor in June of 2008. It was my wife's daily driver up until 2013 when she bought a new Buick LaCrosse. From there I took the car for myself as a daily driver. At 130K miles later this car has been very reliable overall. Yes, like most cars there are some cons but you just learn to live with them. The main cons I see is the cheap hard plastic material used in this model interior. However, in 2011 when Fiat took over the interior got a much-needed upgrade with way better softer materials. The overall layout is good for daily driving where the controls are nicely laid out and user-friendly. One of the big selling points of this model in 2008 besides its new re-design was the heated/cooled lighted cup holders and the glove box cooler. There I was a bit disappointed with these features. The cup holders do not allow the mega-sized cups and the heating/cooling effects are minimal at best. The glove box cooler is a joke as it relies on the AC to cool and the airflow is very minimal. (I now use this compartment for extra storage.)  So basically these features are worthless but were a great marketing tool at the time. The 6-spd transmission shifts smoothly and is very responsive while driving but is not the case when engaging from park to Rev or Drive...very abrupt, and clunky. The ride is fairly comfortable and visibility is good except for the blind spots of the rear pillars and takes some getting used too. I think adding an aftermarket rear camera will greatly help the driver when backing up the car. The gas mileage is decent too. This car does emit higher than normal road noise inside, but the sound system takes care if that dilemma. The Boston Acoustics sound system is decent for a factory sound system. I love the styling of this car both exterior & interior design. This car is considered mid-sized which to me is a perfect size for a daily driver and my wife said its the perfect female sized car.  A lot of folks, (Including critics), are too quick to put the Avenger down in the short term and not giving it a fair chance. With any car, its a machine and parts wear out over time. Too many people think they can just put gas in cars and expect them to last forever and are quick to give negative feedback when something goes wrong. Its all about how you drive and take care of your car will determine it's long range outcome. Great maintenance & TLC goes a long way and my Avenger is proof of that! At 130K miles, it still looks and performs like new. Although it's resale value is poor, which is unfortunate, I would say this car is a good investment for the college student or as daily driver.",4

And of course changed  my oil twice, other than that it runs great and runs quiet and its pretty fast.Electrically I've had some issues I'm not gonna lie like rolling my window all the way down and it took like a hour to roll back up but just happened once.My passenger window had some issues for about a week but all of a sudden it stopped and works fine now.My car just shut off one time at a red light but started right back up and that only happened once last year, I took it to the dealer and they said the car is in good shape and they saw no problems.But this stuff was happening when I first got it but its been a year and a month without no issues it drives great.Maybe I just had to drive out the kinks?I really don't know but I haven't had any major issues at all, its far from a money pit I've had the car 19 months and only spent 150 dollars on a battery.Now these might be big issues for a lot of people who want a perfect car and just love to complain about everything but an issue with my windows for about a week is just not enough to give a bad review! My car shutting off one time on me? Ok I can see why people would complain but it happened once and never happened again I never made it a big deal the dealer said everything seemed good.The good things now.... The sound system is awesome I got six speakers all together and it sounds really good! love the mini fridge up front, Adjustable seats are great, this car also drives really good nice smooth ride with good handle, great exterior look, the interior is a little cheap but no big deal, still looks nice inside.Now the space in this car is great u have a lot of legroom and space, its very spacious.Not the most perfect car but I'm happy with it just a great car and a lot of fun to ride.You guys want a perfect car good luck on finding one because there's no such thing my friend has BMW and my other friend has a range rover sport those are expensive cars and they have had issues with their cars as well.People just love to complain, guess its just human nature.",4
 on 11/04/15 20:56 PM (PST),David Smith ,2008 Dodge Avenger Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 4A),"400,000 MILES AND GOING STRONG"," I bought this car for my daughter after she got divorced in 2013. The car already had 331,000 miles on it. I knew the owner so I had  a complete history. Except for normal maintenance the only thing he had to do was a transmission solenoid because it was starting to leak.  We have spent some money on it this year: i.e; shocks,struts, tie rods, wheel bearing, brakes, tires, an oil pan and the alternator finally went. Not bad for the mileage and certainly expected. The car gets 90,000 miles out of tires, drives great in the snow and on the highway, She has put over 70,000 miles on it in two years with my granddaughter in a car seat the whole way. It is the original motor and transmission.  The 2.4 in 2008 went to a timing chain so no maintenance there. I work in a shop. I never see these for major repairs. I agree with some people that the interior is a bit cheap looking. Dodge did major improvements on their interiors in 2010. The styling is very attractive on the exterior. Like a mini  08 Charger. That being said I am a pragmatist. Dependability is more important to me. My lowest mileage car has 142,000 and we cover almost every make. It still is my favorite.  At 404,000 miles the car shows no sign of slowing down and believe me, my daughter  is not what you would call an easy driver. My youngest son totaled his car. Guess what I'm looking for now?",1

But sadly enough my neon was smaller yet the avenger yields about the same gas mileage so that's a plus but odd enough my neon was faster than this lug of a car. 2.4L 4cyl engine just isn't enough to haul the weight of the car.. If I was buying this car i'd recommend getting the 2.7L or 3.5L. It doesn't have the performance I was expecting but I like the sleek performance look though and get compliments on it especially since mine has 17' Challenger rims on it. But it is a great family car I would say. Also nice that it has Sirius Radio and the cooler for 4 cans of soda which is pretty neat.",4

I bought it used at the end of 2009 with 30k miles (it was a company car for its previous owners) the only thing that was wrong was the plastic that covers the spedometer had a crack, that didn't effect visibility. It was just a crack. I drove this car daily and love itI had the SE so only a 4 cylinder. But it was enough to have a quick start and handled great for me. I made plenty of 1000 mile trips and was great. I skidded on ice and smashed into the side wall twice at 80mph and walked away without a problem. This car is amazing and it saved my life.

At 44,000 miles out of the blue the shifter was stuck in park (yes, I put my foot on the brake!). Apparently there was a recall for this reason and I was NEVER notified. Even though it was covered under warranty AND the recall the dealership was incredibly difficult to work with.Other than that, it runs and handles well. The interior is cheaply made and it shows. Low quality plastic all around. Seats are uncomfortable, especially for long trips and blind spots are literally big enough to fit a semi truck in. ",2.875

It also has a bit of trouble starting once in awhile after I put gas in it. It always starts, though. My service engine light came on last week, and they told me it was a large evap leak? My gas cap was fine, so there could be a small crack in my vapor hose. Nothing major. My mechanic suggested some new spark plugs as well.

Its smooth and relaxed, but doesn't object when you floor it to overtake another car on the freeway. Mind you, 2,4 is already to the ""big"" side, as far as engines go in Europe on middle class sedans. Only bone to pick is that ""chill zone"" a bit useless for me, darkening rear mirror works only when somebody is really riding your tail and default battery is weak- couldn't get car started when outside was ""only"" -20C/-4F, gonna change it for next winter. Other than that, I love this car and it really stands out amongst plain European and eastern cars around me. And there's only 4 Avengers in Estonia",4.5

I drive for work and spend a lot of time inside my car. The second cup holder is located slightly under the console/armrest and it makes it difficult to use.  At 50,000 miles my radio now occasionally shorts out.  I also had a problem that it was just suddenly dying at stoplights however a factory computer update did solve this problem.  It runs well otherwise, the net like seats are difficult to clean because small crumbs get stuck under this material.

They are so uncomfortable that I had to rig up some padding. They actually make my back hurt so bad that if traveling any distance, I have trouble walking. I think it puts pressure on a nerve in my lower back. Does the same thing to my husband who's almost 1 foot taller than me. It's not like a T- shirt where you keep the receipt and take it back if it doesn't fit. Also, the 4 cyl. is very sluggish in the low end but once it gets going it performs pretty good.",3.5

Two biggest complaints are  1. very hard to see out the back window which makes it difficult in parking lots.  2. Transmissions shifts funky if not allowed to warm up for 5 minutes even during the summer.  y wife took it on a 5000 mile trip and averaged 32 mpg, but city driving usually results in 15-18 mpg and normal highway driving is about 27-29 mpg. would buy the charger next time.",4.5

It's pretty powerful for a 4 cylinder and being so heavy, we're not drag racing it, it accelerates and merges onto the highway just fine. I haven't had any problems with it not starting or cutting out, actually I've had no mechanical problems at all with it. All around, it's a solid midsize car. Great on gas, (just took it 1400 miles on highway, 32mpg average) looks good, has plenty of room and feels right at home on the highway.

Interior is somewhat bland and the door panels are very hard to clean.  There is one huge blind spot in this vehicle that I will have to get used to pretty quick.

Turning radius is poor but that seems to be status quo for most vans of this size and year. Gas mileage really isn't that bad for such a huge vehicle, and over many steep hills back and forth on the hwy here in Branson, MO, we get 15-16 mpg on an engine with 135K on it. Transmission went out at 127K, along with the computer(questionable repair by dealer), fuel pump( again questionable repair) and O2 sensor. Some is normal wear and tear, it has towed horse trailers!! Interior design is kinda poor though, its tall to get into, and hard to seat people. If style hasnt changed, Chevy would be my next pick for new van ( mpg and design)",3.25

 on 05/01/18 11:10 AM (PDT),Ron E Dee ,1999 Dodge Ram Van Cargo Van 3500 Maxi 3dr Ext Van,Wanted to Love this van.....eh," We were the second owner of the 15 passenger version, white w/ dark tinted windows. First off I want to say, I really wanted to love this van. It was priced $10k below the comparable Ford 15 pass van. But, now I realize with good reason. We purchased this used, with 45k miles on her from a used car dealer. We bought the extended warranty, luckily! The former owner was a church, or group home, so the miles were hard miles mechanically. Within 6 months the front-end needed a complete overhaul. The first of 2 that would be needed within 100k. More on that later. Then the whole AC system needed replacement: from the compressor to the dryers to the hoses! Fortunately the $1500 it cost was in the last month of our extended warranty, on the dealers dime. Having a big family, the size and ride were very good. And she ran very reliably for us, needing very little maintenance besides the usual, oil, filters, cooling and tires. Tires on this baby were a huge expense, but we only needed one set in 60,000 miles or so. Back to the front end on this series van.... I have a friend who was a Dodge/Chrysler mechanic and he said the front end on these were always wearing out. IMO Chrysler didn't get the design right. The van always creaked and made weird noises, like the geometry wasn't right. Even with the new parts and alignment was done. And the van always felt like it wandered on the freeway. And you were always correcting the steering. At first it was annoying, but I guess you get used to it after awhile. Again, I wanted to like/love the van. But there was always something to complain about, despite the solid reliability it had for us. If you are considering this vehicle? Make sure the front end has been checked. Its quite pricey to do. And it seems the parts only last 40-50,000 miles before you will need another go. The van will run forever. But you will need to repair the front end at some point. Its not an option. Oh.... if the one you are considering has the 4sp overdrive tranny? Don't do it! My mechanic friend said the standard 3 speed automatic is way more reliable, on any Chrysler product in that time period.",4

Overall it's a great car and gets me to work on time with good MPG. Outward visibility is good, but as with most new cars the A and C pillars are quite thick and hard to see around. Thankfully my car has blind spot monitoring which has helped me more than once! The whole infotainment system works exceptionally well. All the menu's are extremely easy to navigate and operate, but the touch sensitivity should be adjustable. More than once I've found myself tapping the same button multiple times trying to get it to register. Navigation, radio controls, climate controls, they're all very user friendly. There are two features that I found annoying. The rain sensing windshield wipers don't work very well. They tend not to be very intuitive and I ended up disabling it. The other feature I dislike is the rear parking sensors. They work very well, but I disabled them because while backing out of my garage they would go insane. Not a fun thing first thing in the morning. Interestingly even after the sensors have been turned off, they still sometimes sporadically work. Sometimes while backing out of a steep driveway the sensors will go off at random. Sometimes they'll sense something extremely far away, something it wouldn't sense if the sensors were turned on. And sometimes they do nothing at all. The other complaint I have is the ride quality. I didn't really know what I was getting myself into when I bought the GT. It rides like a rock in a washer, but that's what it's supposed to do. It corners really well and rides fairly quietly, but due to the terrible roads in my town, the car takes a bit of a beating and I feel most of it too. As a result the plastic panel above the rear view mirror rattles against the windshield and tends to drive me nuts.",5

The seat leather is not the best, my driver seat leather is already stretched out and shows wrinkles when I get out of the car. I weigh 175 lb. On my car the AC comes on for no reason, then cuts off. I'll feel cold air for about two minutes ever so often - with the AC in the OFF position. Navigation is great, but the turn by turn volume is too low, can't turn it up. They removed the best part for 2014..the hidden compartment in the passenger seat..come on dodge!! Bluetooth connection to iPhone is awful. USB isn't much better. The uConnect system is awful...no ApplePlay; that would solve everything.",4

I was firstly delighted by the standard 8.5"" touchscreen control. Absolute pleasure to control music, climate, nav without any distractions. The second thing that I found amazing was the interior cabin space. This C-class compact car almost goes head to head with a D-class sedan. The car has a ride handling that is zippy and fun even though a bit heavy (which is why I feel the mileage is not the best). I've driven 2 5-hr long trips on my Dart since I bought (last 2 months) and I found it to be absolutely delightful.",4.125

I feel like the fuel economy could be a little better for this size vehicle.  Our vehicle had a mangled underbelly pan but it’s not surprising since it’s basically carpeted cardboard.  I bought a new panel and sprayed it with two cans of professional undercoating.  The panel now repels water and doesn’t get soggy and weak in wet conditions.  The motor is actually decent but it’s still a joke compared to the Hemi in my Ram. Too bad the Dart is discontinued it seems like a pretty decent vehicle just hopefully it is reliable long term.,5
 on 02/16/18 08:21 AM (PST),Ryan ,2016 Dodge Dart Sedan Turbo 4dr Sedan (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Not What I Expected From Dodge...," Being only 22 years old, this was the first car I have purchased brand new in 2017 as a 2016 leftover model. I purchased the car to be a dependable daily driver for my one hour commute to work everyday. I loved the look of the car, the 6-speed standard transmission, and deal I thought I got. I am a car and truck enthusiast and I am no stranger to working on vehicles. I have also been driving a standard transmission vehicle since I am 15 and I am a reasonable driver. I was very impressed with the car on my test drive for only having the 1.4L 4 cylinder engine and knew I wanted to take this car home. Bad idea. After three weeks of owning the car the interior already started to rattle and hasn't stopped yet, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. About a month a half into owning the car, third gear started to ""hiccup"" during my acceleration, of course the dealer ""couldn't duplicate it"" when testing it. At 20,000 miles on the factory tires were so choppy I had to put four brand new tires on. At the same time, my brakes also started fluttering as if the rotors were warped. All the dealer could tell me was the tires were bad AT 20,000 MILES! And also that my brakes were fine.  After putting 4 brand new tires on, at about 25,000 miles I began to hear a light screeching sound coming from the front left wheel, kind of like a bearing starting to wear and I have such a bad vibration in the steering over 70MPH that my commute home on the highway is torture. I am currently just under 30,000 miles and am NOT looking forward to what else is to come. I am disappointed with the acceleration with the car now, as it is not like it was the first day I brought it home. When I open the door when its bitter cold out my dash lights flicker and the gauge pods act up. Not to mention the resale on this car is worthless. I am not the kind of guy to complain like this or bad mouth Dodge as I have sworn by them since before I could sit behind the wheel. But I am absolutely positively regretful I purchased this car. It has its benefits that I truly do enjoy, but after dealing with issues I should see until well after 50,000-100,000 miles, I can honestly say I made a mistake buying this car. It is truly a blessing they stopped making this cars.",2

I bought it because I needed something that would do better in bad weather and get better gas mileage. It took some getting used to as far as the power difference but the car has plenty of power for it's vehicle class. I enjoy driving the car. It has great response and braking and is easy to get around in. I was happily surprised at how well it handles snow and ice. The car I bought is fully loaded and it certainly has everything that I need as far as technology goes. I have had no problems with the car at all and I am very happy with this purchase.,5

Not because the Dodge Dart is a poor choice but a fantastic one. I have owned mt Dart since 3/16 and driven over 82,000 miles without one problem. The only maintenance have been the usual oil & filter changes, tire rotation. I replaced the spark plugs well prior to the 100,000 miles manufacturer PM recommendation. Other than that, I average between 37-39 MPG with my 100+ mile commute to/from work(over 500 miles per tank filled). I have owned dozens of Mopar vehicles (old and current) and the Dart is shaping up to be THE most trouble free, cost effective vehicle I've owned.  I get regular compliments on how handsome the car is by strangers. Power is above average with 184 HP; merging/passing any vehicle with plenty of power to spare. Handling is firm but not overly stiff or jarring. The only minor complaint would be the occasional balky six speed manual (6 out of 10 for shifting smoothness). Overall, if you don't mind a 4 door sedan, the Dodge Dart may be THE the best bang-for-your-buck right now in the used car market place. I question any person owning this vehicle (since new) that claims all of the problems they report. I believe it's self induced and not a reflection on how well the car is built.

Mind you yes I drive a lot of miles however at clutch should last more than 36000 Miles. And when it goes out in the first year of me owning it and the dealership will do nothing about it, I feel taken advantage of. The staff at the dealership are very cold and ignore you.

 on 09/05/17 16:52 PM (PDT),Dwayne Bell ,2016 Dodge Dart Sedan SXT Sport Rallye 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Used Dart Purchase," Note:  Trim shown above is incorrect.  The car in this review has 2.4L (not 2.0L) engine and automatic transmission (not manual); review page won't let me change it.  I searched the internet for weeks for the least expensive car that had navigation for my son's first car (he will be moving away for college and I personally love navigation to reduce concern about getting lost).  Came down to two cars:  2016 Dodge Dart and 2016 Mazda 3 (both 4 door sedans).  Although the Mazda was a nice car, the Dodge Dart was much more stylish and comfortable.  The SXT Rallye trim had exterior racing stripes and both my sons shouted ""It's a race car!"" when they saw it and I couldn't back out of buying the car at that point.  The price was VERY good.  But when we looked the car over, it had a damaged rocker panel (caved under for about a foot or more in length - looked like it had been in a crash and the car wound up riding a guard rail).  The dealership offered me $400 off OR they would have it repaired; I asked them to repair it; they subcontracted it out to a body shop in Mobile, AL and unbelievably, it looks brand new again.  Then the dealership only gave us one blade key with zero key fobs.  There was no way to enter the car (after being locked) without the alarm going off.  After about twenty phone calls and two weeks of arguing and aggravation, the dealership finally agreed to provide us two proper key fobs.  That work was done by another subcontractor who claimed that many dealerships are commonly trying to rip used car buyers off and not provide 2 fobs - and he was making a fortune resolving those issues.  Ultimately, we are now very happy with the car.  My son loves it.  It's only got a 4 cylinder engine so I'm not concerned he's going to wind up wrapped around a pole.  The interior is very stylish.  The seats are REALLY comfortable (fabric).  Navigation (remember, the main reason) works well, although not as well as our 2014 Honda Odyssey nav.  If you are patient, sometimes you can find a gem.Update: 6 months later - still love the car, no problems, no issues, still has new car smell.  Black color REALLY shows pollen, minor nuisance not the car's fault.  Would definitely recommend to others as a first car.",4

This is by far the worst suspension on a car I've ever had. Basically unless your on a totally smooth road it is a lousey ride. Plus headlights are not that bright. You can ride around at night with the high beams on and nobody will blink you back to let you know . I would trade it in now but I'd lose a ton of money in the year and a half that I've had it.

 on 08/27/16 23:43 PM (PDT),Gerry ,2016 Dodge Dart Sedan GT 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),Dart GT," Bought a 2016 Dart GT, replacing my 17 year old Jeep. I wanted something that was fun to drive, roomy and had a trunk, after years of driving SUV's and pickups. I tried out the Ford Focus and Mazda 3 sedan. While they handled well, they were cramped compared to the Dart, and I found myself hitting my head on the door frame on both entry and exit from the Mazda. The Dart handles well and gets great mileage (granted, compared to an old Jeep, most anything will get great mileage). The customizable guage display is cool and the 8.4 touchscreen infotainment display is easy to use. I got the Sun/Sound package which gives it a sunroof and 506 watt amp and 9 speakers, so it cranks the tunes. It has the push button starter with remote start, which is nice to get the AC running before I get to the car. It has a power drivers seat with power lumbar adjustment and a number of automated features, such as headlights, high beams and windshield wipers.The only annoyance I have with the car is a rattling that comes from the base assembly for the rearview mirror which seems to be looser than it should be, and so it buzzes against the windshield on occasion.

 on 07/13/16 13:31 PM (PDT),M. Schneider ,2016 Dodge Dart Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),"Rented Once, Just Once"," I had this car for almost a week. Should have picked the Corolla in hind sight. The car is so-so for a rental. I'd be hard pressed to buy one considering better choices out there. The 2.4L engine is smooth and adequate. As long as it holds up long term to higher rev'ing, it will do. The biggest issue is that the transmission has copious amount of slack and I'm fairly sure the whole power train sits on coil springs rather than regular mounts. Under steady acceleration the trans works just fine. When the traffic is caterpillaring down the road between 20 and 50, the power train slack and bounce when going into the accelerator is awful. The torq converter and transmission seem to be both slacking. If Dodge cannot tighten down the transmission, they should at least add shock absorbers to the power train. The front seats are mounted too high for my 6'1"" frame. I bump my head getting out and the rear view mirror blocks a lot of my vision. The brakes only use 1/3 of the pedal travel. What the remaining 2/3 of the travel will contribute to stopping is unknown. Even still, the brakes are linear and not too squishy. Steering is good, surprisingly for this class of car. Stereo is basic in appearance, but does have SXM, Aux input and phone capability. Didn't see HD radio option. Sound is respectable. Vibrations for the road and from the A/C fan at full speed can be felt in the foot well. Handling does remind you that you are in an econo/compact car. It softens road imperfections, but is not a sports car. The switchgear is spartan. The instrumentation is nice and a little retro. Surprised to find auto-headlights. Overall, this car needs a healthy dose of power train work. Once that is done, it may be good for shorter people on a serious budget. The Chevrolet Cruz, Hyundai Elantra, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, VW Jetta, Ford Focus and most other compact cars beat the Dart. The Dart reminds me greatly of the Chevrolet Cobalt or early Kia offerings. No wonder sales are disappointing.",3

It performs MUCH better than cars that are supposedly ranked much higher. Every single problem I've read in reviews has been driver related. For instance, the seat is not ""too high"", it is not fixed and has a very wide range of movement. It's also not as small as they say. I am over 6 feet and 220lbs, and fit just fine.

 on 03/06/16 08:00 AM (PST),Jon ,2016 Dodge Dart Sedan GT 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),2016 Dart GT," LOVE MY 2016 DART GT...I've had my Dart GT for 7 months. This is absolutely my favorite car I've ever owned beating out great cars such as 2004 Mazda 3s 2.3, 2007 Ford Fusion SEL v6 and a 2012 Mazda 3s Touring 2.5.The reviewers of this car are harsh in my opinion. I test drove 2016 Mazda 3, 2016 Volkswagon GTi& GLi, Honda Civic and Hyundai. My decision to buy the Dart GT was pretty easy.....and I havent seen my twin on the road since. I love that. I live in an ocean of Fusion's, Focus' and Corolla's...i love having something different , especially with its visual Alfa Romeo DNA disign que's.My TorRed GT has the fabulous 8.5 touch screen U-Connect system with Sirius, navigation, Technology group, Sunroof-Alpine sound, sport hood and Mopar exterior ground effects. This car is absolutely the best dollar value blending style, size, technology and performance.  I wanted a car slightly bigger than the Mazda 3 but not quite Fusion size. Loving the USB input, it functions flawlessly with my 3000 song library thumb drive. This is my first car without a cd player. I thought that was dumb at first. Now that I have all of my music on a USB drive its simply amazing and powerfull. I love how the system displays most of the album art.The GT cabin is truly uber quiet cabin with regard to wind and road noise. Tire noise is specific to the road surface of course. How hasnt anyone mentioned this. The GT rides on wide 225/40/18's wrapped around gorgeous hyper-black alloys and I usually dont notice any sound. My 2012 Mazda 3 was so much noisier, not even close. Yes, you'll feel joints in the road but not with the noise and punch some reviews state. If you want total silence simply pay twice as much or more. My manager, who owns a Mercedes, loves how quiet my Dart is.The handling is very crisp and reasonably flat. The steering is a tad less responsive than the Mazda BUT well worth the trade off. The low end from dead stop torque was stronger on the Mazda BUT...with that came premature tire wear due to the wheel spin. The GT takes off well from dead stop with out tire spin and will blow past the Mazda in the medium and top ends of the run.Technology and comfort: Okay, gorgeous power leather heated seats and HEATED steering wheel, heated exterior mirrors, blind spot monitor, U-Connect system that will let you hear incoming texts and reply when car is stopped. The phone automatically stores your contact list with every startup. The 9 speaker  Alpine sound system is more pleasing across all frequencies than the 10 speaker Bose in my Mazda because its warmer, adds a subwoofer, a nice surround mode and equally detailed in all other areas. The driver information available and customizable is superb. Tire pressure reading (accurate) for each individual wheel and this is key when riding on 40 series tires, you should know this data always. This was the most technology packed car of the ones i considered. These wheels do not leak air. I was constantly putting air in my Mazda. hmmmmStyle: Please... That is not even close. Again, Alfa Romeo DNA disign que's...My Dart GT has some heads snapping.. Its low and wide on a perfect 18"" wheel & tire package. the low area is wrapped around in the Mopar front chin spoiler, side skirts and rear skirt that accents the big dual chrome exhaust tips. The body has a tasteful hunkered down look, without being too busy like all the Japanese models designed to attract attention in Tokyo grid-lock traffic,  with widened fenders that are in correct proportion to the GT wheel package and the wheel-well opening. The sport appearance hood with scoop is the cherry on top setting it above other Darts and competition. The GT equipped as mine is was not plentiful. Although white was my first choice with TorRed 2nd, the dealer had the red from the car show right on their lot and that in itself gave them a pricing advantage. This car was born to be red in this trim level.Performance: I sit in rush hour traffic and my ego does not require me to drive overly aggressive. That said, my GT gets up to 90 mph extremely quickly and quietly  without fanfare. As far as hardcore numbers, there are plenty of published reviews, for me...I drove the GT, GLi, GTi and Mazda 3 all in the same afternoon and the Dart GT simply screamed ""this is the one"".My only other thought is that I hope its as dependable and drama free as the Mazda's have been because i'd like to keep this car for 4 to 6 years. I love the exclusitivity of driving a car where I never see its twin, at least i havent in the past 7 months. Poor leadership decisions really fumbled this amazing car that FCA has since announced discontinuing. My gain...I love it.K&N Air FilterRokBlokz Mud FlapsTint - 35% front & rear, 20% backBuy this cool sedan in GT or SXT with Ralley package.",5

I had several errands to run this weekend with Christmas just around the corner.  We left the lot with 16 miles and now have 486 on the odometer.   Interior- most cars I've owned in the past have had the cheap plastic coverings on the dash along with very uncomfortable armrests in the doors. This car has a nice 'plush' almost pleathery feel in its place. The interior styling on the SE is not flashy but not dull.Performance- for a 2.0 with no turbo it's decently quick enough for the driving I will be doing. I commute 700 miles a week for work and don't do many hard accelerations. That being said I was not at all disappointed when accelerating. I reset my mpg average when leaving yesterday for a 180 mile round trip. 75% highway I averaged 35.7 mpg over the trip and hit 45.7 on the average on the highway driving at 56 mph.Technology- I wasn't looking for the fanciest car and I sure didn't get it.  There's no remote start, no xm radio, no touchscreen display or anything most newer cars have. It doesn't even have automatic headlights. But I wasn't looking for all of thisSummary- I was looking for a car big enough for me and my family that got good mileage.  That's exactly what I got.

I have 32,000 miles and have had to put it in the shop at least three times for the engine shutting off while driving. Just last week the car died again and had to sit there and wait to start again. I have had to replace the battery already this year. I was getting 24mpg and now down to 22mpg. The car is sluggish when you try to push the pedal to go, do not dare to pull out in front of a on coming car unless the car is at least a mile back!! Spoke with a mechanic (son's friend) and he states that it would have something to do with the transmission. Also, last oil change was told that my fuel injection need to be cleaned. I am so tired of buying cars that constantly have problems. I have never own a dodge and am so irritated that this car is an American car and this is what America sells. The air is loud and also when I am on the phone the person I am speaking with can here the background noise of the car. It is not well built, but America does not build to last anymore.",3
 on 03/27/18 13:02 PM (PDT),Scott Stewart ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan GT 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),Darting Around," The fuel mileage is excellent provided that the car is accelerated gently; therefore, although equipped with the larger 2.4L engine, the car feels sluggish when accelerating (it is heavy for its size).  With the 6-speed manual transmission, I tend to upshift at approximately 2,500 RPM which yields 26 MPG city, 35 MPG highway, combined 30 MPG.  Under ideal conditions, I have exceeded 38 MPG highway.  Since I do drive conservatively, I never have exceeded about 3,500 RPM.In the 18 months I have owned the Dart it has been completely trouble-free – no rattles or loose trim; no “new car” adjustments.  The only services have been oil changes.The clutch engages rather suddenly; despite my previous car also having a manual transmission, it took me quite a while to adjust to this.The interior room is adequate for me, but not great.  I have the driver’s seat adjusted nearly all the way up and all the way back, which results in the non-height-adjustable rearview mirror blocking my forward vision to the right.  Since I do have the driver’s seat set high and back, the door/roof headroom when entering or exiting does require caution to avoid a “dented head.”I cannot comment on the entertainment system, as I never use it.  I wanted the GPS, which I use frequently.  The backup camera and side traffic warning detection are superb.  I am delighted to have the availability of the selectable analog/digital speedometer; I use digital exclusively as I find it much easier to see quickly.I purchased the Dart after its discontinuation, so I was aware of the effect on its resale value.  I was seeking a four-door vehicle with a manual transmission with many options.  If the Dart were still available, it is likely I would have bought another; for me, the positives far exceed the qualities I dislike.",5

 on 02/26/18 01:21 AM (PST),Michael Gallegos ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),I’ve enjoyed owning it," I’ve had my Dart for about two years now, and I’ve taken it on several road trips and a lot of in town driving. Basically, it’s a very good car, but my only problems with it are the exterior being a little cheap. It sits low to the ground so it scraps on curbs all the time (granted that’s my fault, really). Once, I ran over something in the road (I think a piece of concrete or something?) and it blew out my AC, but they were able to fix it easily and it didn’t cost much. Recently, I hit a little cage while pulling into my garage and it almost removed the whole front bumper. Basically, it’s kinda cheap but you have to be more careful with it than I am, I’m a bit reckless, I need a truck or something. Also, the tire pressure will go low super easily. A slight cool breeze will turn that light on. That being said, it’s been on several road trips without giving me a single problem with the engine, gas or anything and it’s survived attempted break ins and a gun shot to the hood (I live in a rough city, what can I say). It’s a very reliable car and it’s very affordable and worth the money! But just a tad cheap and delicate but most of that is my fault",4

The first thing that I can tell you is that there is a difference. The GT feels more solid on the road and the steering is more responsive. My GT only has 15k on it and has so far been trouble free with one small exception.  The idiot light came on for a minor recall and I ended up taking a day off from work for a minor tweaking that could have waited. I have not demanded much of my Dart having parked it in the winters and kept hot dogging to a minimum, so I am a poor candidate for telling you about reliability, but so far so good. What I can tell you is that getting into the dealership is a nightmare with waits of many weeks for service.  Due to the poor performance of the service department I am giving the Dodge Dart 3 stars on what would otherwise be a 4 star car",3

 on 06/07/16 08:14 AM (PDT),Rhonda Z ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Recently rented this car for two weeks," I rented this car for two weeks. I thought the seats were very comfortable, and it was easy to get in and out of the car. Overall I was quite impressed with the car. It was spacious, the trunk held all of my and my daughter's luggage with room to spare. And our luggage tests the limits of the checked and carry-on dimensions. The controls were simple and easy to figure out, the mirrors were easily adjustable, and the ride was smooth. The car was not afraid to go very fast on the highway. I was shocked to see how fast I was going (over 100) at one point because it was gliding over the road so smoothly. I had to set the cruise control to keep myself in check. The only negative things I can say is that it is slow to respond if you want to rapidly increase your speed. But for a four cylinder it is more than acceptable. And the car has such a low clearance that it kept scraping on the pavement. I live in the Rockies and no matter how slow I entered and exited my driveway, it scraped. And no matter how slow I creeped through intersections in neighborhoods, it scraped.",4
 on 05/06/16 08:45 AM (PDT),Russ Furchner ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan GT 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),Solid Car with Alpha DNA," In the sea of compact sedans, the Dart GT stands out.  It's very nice to look at, definitely not your cookie-cutter import.  I honestly don't understand the criticism of the car in general.  The car never feels under powered, the shifts are crisp and positive.  The handling and brakes are very good for a front wheel drive car.  My only complaint was the OEM tires which were overly harsh and really a poor match for this chassis.  Once replaced, you now have a firm riding, quite and comfortable car, but not harsh or jarring.  What you have is a quick, sharp and fun drive that is inexpensive to own and operate.  Good value for money.Update at 34k miles - Aside from Interior rattles, which are quite annoying, still a solid workhorse and fun to drive package.  Perhaps the firm suspension contributes to the rattles, but they are quite annoying when the cabin is gold.  Still happy with the car, just annoyed at that aspect.",4
 on 05/03/16 11:21 AM (PDT),Dave in OH ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Some redeeming features but think twice," Got a chance to rent one of these, and since my daughter will be looking for something used soonish for a first car, I thought why not try it?  Nut shell summary -some stand out features, but would not buy or rent again. Cars should be made to be driven as job 1, not just looked at or sat in.The good?  Appearance was nice in my eyes.  And, the interior was not low rent by any means.  Soft touch material and mostly decent switch gear feel?  Check.  Logical control layout?  Check.   Seats were okay, but not great.  Still, given the price point?  Color me impressed.   A few quirks to note here which kept the rating being higher in these areas.  1) Front seats needs to go lower.  While I can fit...  I have to recline the seat and doing so blocks the speedometer.  So I can either fit comfortably, or not see my speedometer between 50 and maybe around 80.  Tilting/telescoping wheel hopefully is an option, so check if you are a all torso kind of guy like me.  2) Glare off gauge panel.  Given the rest of the interior quality, the lack of a (more?) reduced glare gauge cluster covering seems a noticeable omission.  Not 'can't read it' bad, but still quite annoying when the light glare hits it.And, the mostly not so good.  With the exception of steering, which really does hit the mark for this sort of car, driving dynamics were pretty bad.  So the steering first.  Somewhat lose on center but with good, but not too much road feel.  Tracks well, not too much effort at any speed.  Pretty much exactly what the doctor order for daily driver sort of car and maybe more.  However, the engine was buzzy and lacked any ommph over 45 for the first few days  Had to hammer it to even get up to passing speed in any reasonable time.  After a few days the TCU and engine eventually 'learned' that when I applied gas I truly madly deeply did want it at least _try_ to move faster than a dodering great grandma.  Still even then, it remained rather poor, but at least not almost dangerously so, as was my experience the first few days with it.   Engine noise and vibration were a constant unwelcome companion, especially at idle.  Even the dash liner would visibly vibrate at times.  If Dodge had not put so much effort into the interior it would have been buzzing like my old '78 Malibu did when it was cold.  This is the lowest level of NVH refinement of any other car I have driven or ridden in in the last decade, or possibly two, which is quite a few cars from all price points.  Brakes may have had a warping issue on this car so read as such, and not as directly critical of the car model.  The rears gave a distinctive 'whrrr whhrr' when backing down my driveway.  I had to stop quickly once, and they actually clunked and the car lurched a bit while stopping fast.  I assume this is not normal for a Dart, and did let the rental agency know.  I would however worry about a car that did have brake issues as early as this, even for a rental.  My adivce? Try some emergency stops and braking while backing down a hill to be sure if you are test driving one. Suspension.  On smooth even pavement it was fine, and even a good ride.  However, anything else gave varying degrees of jittery and busy.  Absolutely no confidence in trying anything beyond '20% pushing it' in this car.  Given the brakes, and lack of oomph, that was probably for the better.  Still a suspension should not communicate that it wants to take the car in all sorts of directions you are not steering in on anything but good pavement.  If you live in an area of crappy roads like I do, make sure to try it out first and see for yourself if it suits.  Fairly obviously, I have no idea if it corners fairly flat / has body roll, was not even tempted to try it.   In short?   VW, Mazda, Ford, Nissan, Honda, Subaru, Hyundai, GM... All seem to have better cars in this price range/category from a driving perspective.",2
 on 03/18/16 10:31 AM (PDT),Phil Perkins ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan GT 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),"A quick, sturdy, wonderful car"," I recently purchased my 2015 Dodge Dart GT as a replacement for my old commuter, a 2006 Mazda6. So far, I have not regretted it in the slightest; it is an upgrade in almost every way.As a 6'7"", 250lb man coming from a mid-size sedan, the switch to a compact had me worried. I am the kind of person to do as much research as possible before a purchase like this, but for my particular circumstances there is really no alternative to actually going to the dealership and test driving the car. I am pleased to report that this is the first sedan I have ever been able to sit completely upright in, without hitting my head on anything. My particular vehicle was purchased in 2016, but as a 2015 model I had to take what I could get since I was shopping for a manual, and this car just happened to have a sunroof. That only adds to my headroom, and the cut-out from the room (even with the sunroof closed) adds an extra inch or two for those 'even-extra' extra headroom needing people. As far as legroom, I positioned my chair in a comfortable driving position, then moved to the backseat, and was able to fit behind myself! In a Compact Sedan! If you are a large person, you will understand how impressive this is. Headroom is a bit tight in the rear seats, but the legroom truely impressed me.My personal needs aside, this is a fantastic car. The 2.4 engine in the GT and SXT is extremely competetive for this size car, and with many other larger cars as well. It is a somewhat heavy compact, but the GT holds its weight well. It corners -very- flat, and can pull out of corners with almost no back end feedback. If you're in for a more leasurely roll down the country roads, the GT suspension may be a little more stiff than people are used to, but it is hardly the toughest I've driven. The clutch is smooth and responsive, and if you can aptly shift inside the power band, it will have no trouble finding and keeping revs with you.In my opinion, the interior is the best in the class. For under 20k, You have leather everywhere. Seats, Steering wheel, Console, everything is well built and has no wiggle or give. The doors close solidly and you feel extremely safe inside the cabin. Visibility is high, even from my vantage point at the ceiling, and backing up is a smooth breeze (even without the backup camera). I feel that interiors are an extremely personal opinion kind of thing, but that is mine. After a lot of research with engines, and considering I was restricting myself to a manual transmission, I test drove a Mazda3, Chevy Cruze, and this Dodge Dart. There was little feeling of competition. I have been through many brands of cars in my (relatively short) life. This car is so good that I feel like I may turn into a Dodge man.",5

However the 2.0L could have a little more kick. The voice control is poor, as i had to take it back the day after I bought it (guess anyone can get a faulty unit though) to replace the uconnect. The car drives great and fuel efficiency is great on the highway but could need improvement on city streets (29.8 mpg combined for me, 37 hwy, 24-25 city). Pros: - Great car for the money- Great Safety features- Great factory speakers- nice adjustability of seats- Awesome cargo space- Good on hwy gasCons:- somewhat slow takeoff- Uconnect issues- instrumentation can be slightly confusingI just bought this car, so the review may still get changed.",4

 on 09/16/15 21:58 PM (PDT),John E ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),One word RECALL!," Ok so for starters this car wasn't my first choice. I previously owned a 2008 V6 Ford Mustang and it was great while it lasted but unfortunately it was it's time with over 140,000 + miles on it. I was in need of a car because that was my only transportation at the time. I ended up buying the base model Dodge dart with the black top package. In my opinion it definitely has the looks it's a great looking car and a good size not too big or small. Especially how everything is black on black and also has tint so it looks awesome. But I was kind of bummed that I didn't receive the black rims instead I received the charcoal colored wheels. The interior is nice, good materials nothing really cheap looking it looks good inside and out. But now the bad parts! Well first the control stick was frustrating when I test drove it I didn't pay any attention to the fact that their is only one control stick on the left side of the wheel. It was annoying but I eventually got used to it. The biggest problem the TRANSMISSION! Wow the transmission is awful but I should have known coming from Chrysler that this would be an issue. The car jerks at times when I slow down or excellerate. It shakes pretty bad right in between the process of stopping and excelleration. When I start the car it shakes when Parked. And the dealers answer for this was that the car is ""warming up"". Very very poor excelleration but once it gets to a certain rpm its decent. It has this horrible lag when you try to speed up. And the answer I received for this and the shaking and jerking was ""the computer is trying to learn your driving habits"" that's bull dodge! I have had transmission issues with my mustang before so I know exactly what a bad transmission feels like. And now I'm proven right. Just recently saw articles saying 2013,14, and 15 models are being recalled for faulty transmission surprise surprise! And the gas mileage for being a 4 cylinder isn't all that great definitely not what they promise anyways. I regret getting this car but I'm stuck with it at least for a bit. I would avoid it just don't bother please don't make the same mistake I did.",3
 on 09/08/15 19:12 PM (PDT),JLB ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan Aero 4dr Sedan (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),2015 Dodge Aero Dart," When I bought this car, it seemed nice.  Traded in a 2010 Dodge Charger because I wanted better gas mileage and safer winter driving (it was rear-wheel drive - in Denver CO). I agree with the review where take-off is sluggish and 6 gears are too many - like it can't decide which gear to be in and the drive can be choppy.  I complained to the dealer about the poor take-off acceleration and he said it is to save gas.  It's like the car is telling ME when I should go.  Very frustrating.  Once it gets going over 35-40 mph, it does do very nicely, handles nice, and is relatively quiet for a small car.  The turbo is great.  The air conditioner has a cheapy fan sound that is inherent in Darts per the dealer, and the brakes are always squealing, which two dealers say is due to the metal they are now using, but ""it helps it stop on a dime"".  I just have to ""keep the brake dust power-washed off"", which I would have to do every other day.  They say it's on all cars after 2005, but I don't hear other people's car's brakes squealing as I drive.  The Aero is rated at 32 mpg city and I get about 27.  Not the gas savings I was expecting.    As I drive stop-and-go a lot, this car is VERY frustrating to drive - I am constantly telling it to ""GO!"" when I give it gas from a stop and hills are worst.  But, on the open road, I did get 53 avg mpg!  But, I am on my 3rd check engine light since 2500 miles (car now has 4700) and they can't find the problem because of how complicated they've made everything.  I would run this car off a cliff if I could.  I have had Dodges for 20 years since I worked for Chrysler at one time but I'm done now.  This is NOT a worthy replacement for the Neon and I wish I had my Charger back!",3
 on 08/16/15 15:14 PM (PDT),Michael Keogh ,2015 Dodge Dart Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),"Very nice, stylish, daily driver."," This review will come across as confused. I love the look of my 2015 Dodge Dart SE auto with Rallye Package (auto option was not available in this review page). The car is comfortable, rides very well, and is quiet. The stylish exterior belies its performance. Handling is adequate for a 4-door sedan. The suspension springs are too soft to qualify this car as a sport sedan. The acceleration with this 2.0L auto is lethargic. Six speeds is too many. The transmission is always shifting trying to find the perfect gear ratio. One would think that would help fuel economy, but it doesn't. 99% of my driving is city driving and I am averaging just 22 mpg. You'd think with a 2.0L, 4-cylinder, MPG would be better. This is probably attributed the car's heft. The one good thing about the Dodge Dart is that it is cheap. With generous incentives and a well negotiated price, I purchased my car new for just over $15,000. I needed a cheap 4-door sedan, and this seemed the best option for a new vehicle.",4

It's my second car. I bought the car brand new and the problems started within the first month. It has only 30,000 miles on it. Never in an accident. A few scratches due to trying to pry the fuel door open because it freezes shut. But in good physical shape. Started with tire problems. I blew a tire on a pot hole that any decent tire should have handled with no problem. I live in Michigan so granted, our roads are terrible but you get really good at playing the pot hole game. You know the one where you swerve to avoid the big ones, hold your breath when you go over bad ones, and cringe every time I hit even a tiny pot hole. In the few short years that I've had it I've had to replace THREE tires due to them blowing out. Numerous patch jobs. I was told over and over that it wasn't possible to put ""non low profile"" tires put on so I just had to deal. That's just the beginning. Within the first few months the electrical problems started. First the touch screen would just restart every so often....software update fixes that for a while. It started doing it again.  I also just dealt with that as long as it would come back on. Which it did. Until it didn't. My heat and ac made weird noises that no one could figure out. My odometer started flashing one day and would t stop. The mileage would go up as normal but it would just flash. Nothing else on my dash would blink. Headlights wouldn't turn on a few days later. The fog, daytime, and brights worked so the bulbs weren't burnt out. Rear lights were normal. The best part? This winter it started shutting off completely every time my ABS would kick on. Again, I live in Michigan. It's icy and this car is a POS. But the car would start right back up on its own a split second later. Took it to the dealership and was told that basically the car wasn't recognizing the electrical system or something like that. Okay made enough sense to me. A little less then a month later, I go to start my car this morning and it starts up fine. But my whole center counsel wouldn't work.  I could use my Bluetooth via my phone itself but the screen was black. I could control the volume by the steering wheel controls but the physical knob did nothing. My heat was on full blast (I didn't leave it on full blast) and I couldn't turn it down/off because that knob was also not working. I was told that in order to even figure out what was wrong with it, I'd have to replace the whole center counsel. Because guess what? That's how they diagnose the electrical problem. That would cost almost $2000 (not including labor) Just to replace it. Then there's still the matter of finding and fixing the problem on top of that $2000 + rental car. I decided it wasn't worth it because I've long been looking into my options financially to get rid of this thing. Had it appraised at the dealership and guess how much its worth. $5000. It was a deal to even get that trade in value. Yesterday it would have been worth $7000+ to trade in with the working screen. Even with the problems it was having.  So go ahead and do that math. Needless to say, I signed the lease for a new car today.",1

Bought mine used with 25,000 miles and now have 48,000. It's definitely not a car to drive long distances in. Seats are uncomfortable for extended trips. The low profile tires suck. Already blew a tire and cracked the rim on a pothole. Other than that it has been a very dependable car.",4

It has a manual transmission with 40K miles. I was on the highway off ramp with the clutch pushed in and the car in neutral when the clutch exploded.  Clutch, pressure plate, flywheel, throw out bearing, slave cylinder, starter all need to be replaced. Chrysler said this is NORMAL wear and tear.  Bought for $12000 today's trade in value $5500 minus $2900 dollar repair = $9400 loss in 1.5 years  DO NOT BUY A DART!!!!",1
 on 08/28/17 18:16 PM (PDT),Dartowner ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),First new car purchase. worst experience!, My suggestion is buy any other brand besides chrysler and even if you have bad service it still won't be as bad as chryslers. The car itself is ok. There have been a few issues though. Heater and a/c controlles stopped working. Had the headliner replaced because at night when I would press the brakes the rear window would glow red from the headliner sagging (still didn't fix it). Lost my brakes (stiff pedal) and had to use the e brake to slow down. Called chrysler road side they said the tow would be free and the brakes will be covered by the recall. They told me the car is being towed to a dealer and that everything will be taken care of and they said it will be a 2 week wait. 3 weeks later I call the dealer and they have my car but no info. Hmm chrysler will not take care of anything. They care about selling there product not making customers happy. I will never buy another chrysler product!,2
 on 08/12/17 19:02 PM (PDT),aaron hughes ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),enjoy like a porsche... cost like a pinto," I bought a pitch black 2013 dodge dart, and I added tinted windows and paid for some extras.  The car drives very well for the cost!  The depreciation on the blue books are stupid to drop the value so much.  I have had very little trouble with this car.  I take care of car with oil changes, pay for the better gas now and then will help the performance.  I enjoy the looks to be sporty, has been very reliable... I do believe this is not a car for 4 persons to ride in across the country though.  Buying this car for one or two persons  is what is for.  Not a family car to have unless you just want the baby seat in the back.   Acceleration is awesome.  A great buy and I don't plan on wanting to sell it anytime soon.  So [non-permissible content removed] the blue book that way!",4
 on 06/07/17 17:56 PM (PDT),Andy ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Dodge Dart SXT Honest Review," I bought this car back in 2016 with 6,600 miles and it now has 17,500. I have had no problems with the car besides one small flaw. It seems whenever the weather changes drastically the wiring glitches. A couple of times my airbag lights would come on only to turn off after a few minutes of driving. This only happened when the weather shifted over night. I live in Chicago and this is my daily driver. I had no problems in the rain or snow. I have also driven this car on plenty of road trips between 100-300 miles trips, not once an issue. I do not know what people are saying about noise or shaking around 70mph because I had to issues and my average highway speed is 90. Highest I went was 96 and still no issues. I routinely inspect my car and change the oil myself every 3,000 miles. It seems to me people do not know how to properly maintain their vehicles. The MPG is great, on highways I would record the mpg on trips. I easily hit between 31-34 mpg on trips which is great, about $25-30 to fill from E. My Dart is an automatic with no touchscreen. A very basic SXT, but I do not need anything else. No complaints on the driving, the acceleration may feel lagged but it is a 4 cylinder small sedan. That's what you are buying, not a rt charger. It gets me from point A to point B. The brakes are very well, numerous times I would have to brake and the ABS kicked in and stopped pretty fast. I've had some people complain about the back seats not having a lot of room, but most of my passengers are 6+ ft so I would expect that in a small little sedan. I am 6'02 and I have no problem with the room, easily an average sized male can fit into this car. My suggestion is test drive the car, if you like it then buy it. When I was looking for a car I had no intentions of buying this car until I sat in the driver seat. Instantly I wanted it. If you have doubts then do not buy it. You buy a car that you like and are happy with. Buying a car is always a chance. There is problems with every company and every car they make, not one is perfect. So far im liking my purchase, if anything for some reason does happen I will sure update this ASAPUpdate: Still no problems, the traction control light would come on and I took it in and there was a recall with a vacuum hose that actually ended up being the problem. Cost me nothing and was fixed within an hour.",4
 on 05/01/17 16:17 PM (PDT),Kathleen ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Dont do it," My late husband bought this car for me  on February 26th 2013 . In the beginning I was taking it in a lot for minor things to the recalls . But every time I got it back the check engine light would come on. I have replaced the tires twice, both headlights and now it only has 40,000 miles on it and the engine has been replaced took them 72 days to replace it. Also had to take it back twice after the engine replacement to get the turbo hose changed and for them to reconnect the AC. And now they have had it again for 4 weeks to replace a hose. From the engine replacement to this hose issue has all been in less than 6 months.Update. I'm still having issues with this car. Now my turbo is acting up",1
 on 01/03/17 17:27 PM (PST),Keyan ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),I really enjoy this car," So I have owned two darts in my lifetime and sadly my first one got totaled while I was stationed in Germany. Im on my second one now and I have nothing but stress free driving owning this car. Ill break this down based on the overall rating breakdown.                                                                                                                                PERFORMANCE: The 2.0 I have doesn't have enough power for the weight of the car so acceleration is pretty slow but steering is excellent. The car always feels connected to the road and I really enjoy curvy roads in this car. The transmission is just ok unless its in manual mode.                                                                                    COMFORT: I have the fabric seats and they are just fine for me but I am only 5'6 so that will vary from person to person. Also the car is pretty solid on the road and stays very quiet with the right tires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    CARGO: Trunk space is good and seats fold pretty flat.                                                                                                                                                                                                      INTERIOR: I have the base interior so not that exciting but everything works. If your looking to buy this car you should look for one with the tech package.                   SAFETY: I was in a really bad accident with my last Dart and I honestly I didn't feel a thing even though I was T-Boned by a car going 100kph. I think its very safe.           TECH: My only tech is bluetooth and the USB plug and they both suck at times Some times it takes a while to connect.                                                                                     RELIABILITY: So far after 80,000 miles I have had zero problems with this car and maintenance has been cheap but if I have any major problems ill update this.            VALUE: This is a good car for the money but im not sure about the long term vale since the Dart is no longer in production.                                                                            OVERALL: This is a nice car but I would recommend the 2.4 if you are looking to buy one because of the bigger engine.",4
 on 12/08/16 16:49 PM (PST),Lori ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),It's a computer/laptop on wheels," I had no idea how computerized this car would be.  I have a 2013 turbo and I have had to replace the voice module 2x, transmission module 1x and a couple others.  I have to take in my car to the dealership roughly twice a year for a system update.  Again, it's a computer on wheels.  When any modules go out, it's as if you are on the blue screen of death.  It scares me to drive it out of town so I have been renting cars for over a year now at least once a month, but I also rent because I have put on 82,000 miles on my car.  The computer aspect, very unsettling.  One more downside, if you are tall or a larger individual or plan to use it to drive 4 teens or adults, I hope you are going only a short distance because you are going to be cramped.  The trunk space fits groceries.  On the positive, with the exception to everything said prior, I love this car!  There is a short lag but once you get past that, you are gone.  I love the sound of it when I turn it on and drive it but then, I'm a gal that has owned a '69 Camaro and '69 Chevelle so I like my cars to be heard.  My car is a limited edition and it has everything you can imagine.  Would I buy it again?  It is more computer than machine so I would have to say no.  When anything computerized goes out, you are stuck wherever it decided to stop which means you are at its mercy.  I need something I can depend and rely on.  This isn't that car.  There have been many electrical problems.  Don't buy it unless if you are comfortable driving a computer/laptop on wheels.",2

The engine cover that is underneath constantly gets stuck on things and needs replacement. I'm about to have to replace it for the 2nd time. The engine shakes constantly.

 on 06/11/16 18:26 PM (PDT),Juan ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Not good," I bought my Dart brand new at the dealership with 14 miles in October 2012. Literally three days after I bought it, someone either put or I picked up a screw in my tire. $130 for a tire. We had a pretty typical winter in 2013, but somehow there was ice that got built up under the wheel well on the driver side, and it broke off a piece of the bumper. I had a headlight go out shortly after that, and I hit a deer a week later which dented the hood. I was told that it would cost ""at least $1000"" to fix the hood, even though it was very minimal cosmetic damage - but because it was a certain type of hood it needed to be repaired. I haven't had to be in a garage for multiple days - but toward the end I was getting expensive repairs. The roads up here are not good for low-profile tires - I blew three tires on potholes and had to get a wheel bearing replaced. I also had the windshield crack for no apparent reason, the moonroof wouldn't close, and so forth. A cousin of mine recommended I get another vehicle. Found one yesterday (6/10/16) and traded it in. It was going to need a whole new suspension and it was less than 4 years old, and had been in Florida when I worked down there. Glad to be rid of it.Also the Dealer (Hartley's in Newport, ME USA) was garbage. They charged me $119 for a tire rotation that didn't solve the problem. $80/oil change as well.",2

It came with most of the features that I wanted, such as Bluetooth, satellite radio, remote start and fog lights. It has the Rally trim, which included the red exterior with black accents, along with the black/red interior striping. The car looks very sharp and its fun to drive. It came with the 2.0 tigershark engine and the automatic transmission, which work very well together. It has served me very well for over 4 years with no major mechanical problems.   11/06/16..update.. The car is still fun to drive but has developed some quirks that I am trying to understand. The security system has a glitch that will cause the doors to lock and the horn to sound while just sitting in my driveway. I had to disconnect the battery a while back in order to stop the horn from blowing. The key fob was not able to silence the alarm. After replacing the battery in BOTH key fobs the problem appeared to be resolved, but the doors will still occasionally lock for no apparent reason.",4

This was the first new car I have ever bought in may of 13, the car was great for the first 3-4 months. My car was backed into and I had to take it in to have the bumper replaced, while in the garage the told me there were ""updates"" for my computer. This is when everything went down hill. A month or so later my cruise control function stopped working, went back to garage of course they couldn't duplicate it so it's still not fixed. Next up there I'd a glitch with the abs, when I slof on ice with my foot on the brake all my electronics/lights fail. The rotors on the drivers side are both shot after 10k miles but the other side was fine dodge says it's normal wear and tare. Then my passenger side sun visor broke off, has that replaced finally most recent is has to have the car towed from Walmart this past December cause it wouldn't start. Turns out the battery shorted out. Obviously there is a computer problem with this car that they do not want to fix! My car has 26k on it tried to trade it in but was only offered 9k for it.

Without master craft glacier grip II tires in the snow the traction and handling is horrible. The car has only 48,000 miles on it and already have had to replace cooling hose and alternator. The head lights are very poor and the car was made extremely cheap. In comparison to other economy cars like the ford fiesta and Subaru impreza the dart has a ton of work to do. The gear ratio is too close to be a fast car. Gears one, two, and three are very close. I would not recommend this car to anyone and it is a shame that my family and I have had such a bad experience (we were dodge fans).

 on 09/17/15 15:42 PM (PDT),Derek Schwartz ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Wholly unsafe vehicle.," This vehicle is another example of an ""American"" (owned by Italians, Fiat) company putting out a substandard product that should not be on the market.  I own a 2013, Dodge Dart Rallye 1.4l, manual transmission.  The hydraulic system for the clutch has failed not once, not twice but three times and the vehicle barely has 37000 miles!!!  The second time we were traveling through the Smokey mountains, thankfully we were able to coast to the next exit and get the vehicle working again. When I say that this vehicle has endangered the lives of my family, it is no exaggeration.  As you can read in any of the other posts, this vehicle is plagued with an assortment of other issues.  (P.S.  The vehicle is still sitting at the dealership for the third instance of the clutch going out).Vehicle aside, Chrysler customer service is run by what seems to be children who have no grasp on the real issues that their customers are experiencing.  The second time this happened I was in the middle of moving to a new base and was unable to retrieve the vehicle for sometime.  This was of no import to the people of Chrysler Case management, I had to request two different case managers due to their unwillingness to return phone calls.  Finally after sitting at a dealership in Tennessee for 2 months they returned my vehicle, less than a week after I received it, the clutch failed again!All beware who buy this vehicle, it is not economical, and it is certainly not safe!",1

I've taken it to two different dealers and have gotten two different reasons why is doing it. But neither say it can be repaired.  One says it's a design flaw, the other just doesn't know why. Bottom line, it's a great looking piece of junk. I wonder if it was really built by Yugo!UPDATE:  Finally figured out what the noise was.  The front brake caliper brackets were lose.  They repaired that and that noise stopped. Both front doors had to be opened up and tightened to stop rattles. I just drove this car to Florida (From Illinois).  Did well but the road noise was tremendous!  So much it just about drove me mad!  Still quite disappointed in this car.  I wish I would have looked at the reviews before I took this home!!",1

I lived in northern mb for my first winter with the car and was a little concerned about how it would hold up in -40C weather but it did great. I never had trouble starting it.

 on 09/08/14 18:36 PM (PDT),stubb1 ,2013 Dodge Dart Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),Love my  '13 Aero-Still," I have had my Aero since December 2013.  I test drove almost everything in the class but settled on the Aero manual 6 spd 1.4L turbo based on price, options and fuel economy.  This car is fun to drive, handles great, and gets better than advertised mileage.  I have almost 20,000 on the car now and have taken it on several long road trips.  The seats are comfy, the power is great even on the highway, and it is a real treat to drive on mountain roads.  I can't understand the C rating here.  For the last week I have also been driving a 2014 Corolla S and I can't stand it.  The Dart has more pickup, better  mileage and handling, and more room.  All for about 4k less.  Update:  I now have about 50k on the odometer and have done everything from city driving to long road trips.  I got a recall notice from Dodge to replace the clutch master cylinder due to some internal part problem affecting the 2014 model.  I did experience this and will have the work done.  But other than that the car is still a thrill to drive, gets great highway mileage, usually about 42-43 by dash monitor, which has been +/- 0.5 mpg compared to fuel and miles calculations so generally reliable.  I've gotten as high as 46 mpg between LA and San Diego on a drive with no traffic.  The car remains a pleasure to drive.  The  handling and braking are confident and the acceleration on the road with the turbo is both fun and useful.  The gearing and the small displacement means you won't be winning any quarter mile races as a start from dead stop is slow, but at speeds when you need power it really shines and literally leaps when you hit the accelerator or downshift.  I have rented many cars in the last year that would be considered competitors such as corolla, elantra, sentra.  When in those, I wish I was back in my Dart.  The Dart seating is more comfortable, the driving experience is much more sporty and satisfying.Update2:  Getting the master cylinder replace put a lot more response into the transmission.  It took a while to get it in and by the time the issue was showing up.  Completely repaired by the recall.  Tires needed replacing and I put some quality all-season Kumho Ecsta 4XII tires on and that made the handling in tight turns even better.  I have kept up with scheduled maintenance such as spark plug replacement, etc.  My son now has the car at college, and when I visit, I use the car and want it back.  My regular car is a Charger, so saying I miss a small displacement ralley car is significant.",5

I purchased it on July 31, 2013, brand new, and it seems like as soon as I pulled off the lot, it went downhill from there. In April, I ended up having to get the alternator and a belt replaced. It locked up while I was driving, not to mention the fact that I was just about to get on the interstate for a trip. After that, I experience a burning smell for weeks. Ended up having to have the oil pan replaced. Now, here in August, my car won't crank. It keeps dying on me and one minute, it seems like the battery, the next someone is saying it's the alternator.

 on 05/08/18 14:15 PM (PDT),Michael Elston ,2000 Dodge Neon Sedan ES 4dr Sedan,Not a bad little quirky commuter," I bought my 2000 Dodge Neon (Plymouth also made some) about eight years ago, for $600 from a guy who had bought his wife a new car and parked the Neon beside his house.  When I made my offer, it had been sitting for two years on four flats and had a dead battery.  Four new tires and a battery later, I changed the oil and set about chasing about a half-tank of watery gas out of it (took a lot of alcohol).  Once the bad gas was out of it, the engine ran smoothly and had good compression, despite having 159,000+ miles on it.  The fuel gauge is quirky; Filling the tank brings the needle down to 'E', and it slowly rises to 'F' as you drive.  I'm used to it - no need to fix.  Since I have owned it, the timing belt has been replaced, front driver-side hub replaced due to whine during right turns, headlights have gotten the obligatory polish to clear up the milky look (we put men on the moon, and we can't fix this stupid problem??), and had brake pads replaced (rotors fine).  Not bad maintenance for eight years.  220,000+ miles now, still getting better than 28 mpg.  Not the car you want for long trips (more than 100 miles and you feel beat-up), but a great commuter, which I believe was the design intent.  Starts reliably on a cold day, handles well, solid fuel economy, noisy but easily drowned out with a few more watts, overall not much to complain about.",4

With proper winters it's decent in the snow as well.  Have had to replace some sensors and seals but nothing major and the car is 16 years old.

I bought it off the previous owner for 1300 with about 163000 miles. The only issue I have had was replacing the radiator which is known to crack in these cars.It was fairly cheap for me since my boyfriend is a mechanic, about $160. Other than that its just the little things that do not mechanically affect the car, which for 1300 is a steal! Gas wise its great only spending like 25 dollars to fill up every week and a half to 2 weeks. Its very comfortable and a great get around car. I feel comfortable doing my occasional 6 hour roads trips every now and then. It really picks up some speed. Overall its a great car.

Although i had good credit the dealer told me it wasn't good enough (720) and charged me 2 extra points at the very end of the deal. I had already sold my old car so i needed it.  After i figured how much money they screwed me for i vowed never to visit the dealer again. Guess what?  I didn't have to!  Now it is July 2016 and the Neon has 209K miles on it and has only broken down once. The nylon clip that holds the shifter to the cable under the boot fell off or broke. The repair was $125 total including $65 for towing.  I have kept up with all the maintenance (timing belts, fluid changes, strut changes,etc.) and i would take the car on a 5,000 mile round trip tomorrow if i needed to. I am 6 foot 4 tall and age 56. The car is comfortable to drive and sit in for long drives. I love the manual transmission as i consider myself a spirited driver and 2nd and 3rd gear pull really good although i don't have a tachometer. Although i live in the south i have driven in deep snow in NH and good quality tires help. The only recommendation i can make is to change the coolant every 2 years vs. 5. I think i replaced an o2 sensor and a knock sensor in 2012. The a/c works great although summer mpg's are about 25 and winter is 30 or 32. Book value now is about $1000 but i couldn't buy one this well maintained for the price. I will say if mine gets totaled for any reason i would probably buy another one.  New car prices are ridiculous and i don't ever want to finance a car again. I will keep it until the wheels fall off. Even if the motor blows i might just buy another motor.

Now it is 2016 and only at 119k. Was mostly for college and getting to all my jobs during that time. Now I am out of college, with a good paying job, and I could buy a new or used car that is up to date and shiny, but the Neon is still going. I have never had to repair a single thing motor/engine wise except for the timing belt (obvious maintenance) which I made sure to do around 90k or a little earlier (not sure exactly when). My car has even been hit by drunk drivers and many idiots and yet still holds strong after body repair. The only issues I have had was the sunroof and leaking. It went off the track and broke. Instead of getting it fixed, I just had a body shop place the roof back in and remove the fuse that allowed it to open and close. It leaks around the sunroof, and weirdly around the passenger side area where the feet go. I think its just blocked up and moves into the floor. Besides its lack of physical beauty at this age in the game, it has done me very well and I will drive this car until the wheels fall off. :}",5
 on 11/30/15 08:01 AM (PST),Vinh ,2004 Dodge Neon Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Honest Opinion," Overall this car has served me well. I bought it brand new back in highschool ,in 2004 for 11k that's including taxes. When I first got it the O2 sensor needed to be replace which isn't a good sign around 20k. Luckily it was still under warranty. Since then there has been no major issues until now but right now at 220k its expected. At the moment, the reverse cable probably has to be replaced or at least one of the pins or bushing. The drive shaft also needs to be replaced which is normal for the a vehicle with the amount of mileage this car has. Both issues occurred around 219-220k. I had to replace the CAM sensor at 110k and oil switch at 185k. Changed the battery twice .Other than that no major issues. I have drove this car from -CA-TX-MT and CA-FL with no problems. I  hit a deer at 40mph with only hood, fender, bumper damage, but nothing was damaged under the hood. The car gets good MPG on the highway but not too good mpg for its class in the city.  I usually get between 35-44 on the highway and 25-29 in the city. Since its high mileage the values have been 25/35 unless I go on a long distance trip. The interior looks good the only thing a bit worn out is the arm rest and front driver seat.Acceleration and handling is also good and I do like the tow capacity this vehicle has. Overall I got my moneys worth but at this point its time to move on.",4

I knew it was old at the time and maybe the dealership played a big role in why I am giving this car such a bad review. All four tires needed replacing after 1 month. A couple months later i had to replace the battery. A short time after that, i had to get the engine flushed. Breaks went out. At random times it would not shift into drive and when it finally did it would jolt forward. Half the time it would not start. The check engine light would come on at random times as well and it would stall out every time i got past 10 mph. I paid it off after all the hell it put me through and then it just shut down and would not start again. I had every intention of driving it for the remainder of my stay in college (which was only 1 year) and then trade it in for a new car. Instead i ended up trading it in (for $300) and getting yet another used car that i really could not afford.

AND I've still got over a quarter inch of pad on THE ORIGINAL brake pads! I'm hoping to make it to 100,000 miles on the original pads. Anyway, the car has been great.

But, this car offers great features at a relatively low price.  However, the low cost is evidenced by a few minor things such as manual rear windows.  But, these are definitely made up for by the look and performance of the vehicle.  First thing I did was put Bosh Platinum 4 spark plugs which increased my gas mileage and performance.  I get anywhere between 32-35 mpg with this car.  My only parts repair has been the starter so far and I have owned the vehicle since it only had 28,000 mi on it.   Due to no under carriage, I destroyed my motor from high water.  Totally my fault, but I (quite easily) put a new engine in and it runs great",4.875

We have taken this car on several road trips and found it to be excellent on the highway (except for a bit of road noise). Driving in snow is a bit of a challenge though.  The trick is to keep excellent tires on the car!  I find the engine weak, but reliable and I am always concerned by the clatter she makes when she starts up.

The interior is ok but I feel like Dodge could of taken it a little further than just cheap hard plastic.

The neon would be better if the seat fabric was better and could be cleaned easier. The trim moldings fade really easily too. I bought the car for what the dealership paid and it's value is dropping daily. Overall it is a really good dependable car, but the re-sale isn't there.

It was a bit sluggish - but it is only a 4 banger, so I tried putting in a K&N air filter and what a difference that made.

The dealer also programmed the door remote I purchased elsewhere and gave me another when I took it in for the 0340 code. It has been fun to drive. It is a bit noisy on the highway and rough roads, but come on, it is not a Lexus. I am not regretting buying it. I have an '05 PT Conv and the dash is almost identical.

The owner before us was an old lady who had pasted away. She treated the car like it was her first born child so I know the issues didn't come from her driving it. The transmission is terrible. It slips, backfires, and sometimes doesn't even go into gear. The engine has terrible power and constantly leaks oil. The coolant tank leaks. The electronics are terrible. Interior lights don't work anymore. Interior is cheaply made. The dash has bubbles all over it. The back windows leak whenever it storms which makes the inside of the car soaked. The engine is extremely loud, it sounds like you have all the windows down whenever you're driving it. The car vibrates, shakes, and knocks. Headlights have terrible visibility. The only thing that's decent in this vechicle are the speakers. It has a great, stock sound system. The reason I'm writing a review on a 14 year old car is because they're cheap to buy now but I honestly wouldn't waste $500 on this car because you'll end up putting 10x that in repairs.

 on 09/28/16 00:55 AM (PDT),Rick Bindhamer ,1999 Dodge Neon Sedan Highline 4dr Sedan,Neon igreat car for teens or those on a low budget," Neons are typical of low frills standard economy cars. While not sexy or in any way a head-turner, they are still kind of cute and a great used vehicle for a teen's first car and a good daily driver. They are pleasant to drive and fairly comfortable for the occasional long distance trip (as long as you're sitting in the front.) The rear seats are less comfortable, but not as bad as many similar economy vehicles. One of the best thing about Neons are that they are pretty darn dependable as long as you keep up the regular maintenance. The one very common, quirky problem are chronic electrical connector problems with the dash cluster. This is a well known defect in this vehicle in that the electrical solder joints in the clusters are prone to being weak and the clusters invariably end up with cracked solder joints. causing intermittent or continual bad connections. (The speedometer/odometer not working or erratic, other gauges not working, trouble-lights coming on, etc...) Replacing the cluster usually ends up with the replacement cluster eventually experiencing the same problem. But there usually isn't actually a need to replace the cluster. Instead, remove it and have someone with basic soldering skills, re-solder all the joints. Re-install the cluster, and most of the time it will work fine.",4

The center tail light seal failed thus filling the trunk with rain water. The power windows misaligned after 3 years making the doors very difficult to open. The power door locks stopped functioning on the rear doors. Now, with  only 47000 very gentle miles on it, the rear main seal blew out putting a quart of oil on the road every 60 miles.

The car's age is showing, and moved. The new dealer isn't up to the same standards as the old one.  They kept the car two weeks without completing any repairs and I finally went with my extra key and took the car back. That isn't the car's fault.

I have driven it every day and had no major problems other than:  The 4 cyl has a not so known issue of the valve cover gasket leaking oil into spark plugs. This was found by a mech telling us so I have yet to replace gasket. I take the plug out clean it and it's good to go for a few months longer.  Secondly is I have to put oil in it cause the oil pan gasket is bad.  BUT knowing those two problems I am ok with it.  It is known for bad heads and often blow.  I haven't had that issue yet!

As a home mechanic I also appreciate how easy the car is to work on. At 150k miles I really went through the engine and replaced the timing belt, water pump, oil pan gasket, power steering pump, valve cover gasket set, thermostat, and it was all really easy to get to with out much trouble at all.

For a car with 250+ miles, this little machine still goes. We bought it as emergency transportation when our minivan's tranny blew and my wife still calls it her baby.  When we bought it, it was dirty and needed some TLC. The speedometer hadn't worked for a while.  It turns out a little soldering on some contact points fixed it.  The job took about an hour and cost nothing. Brake pads have been replaced twice since we've had it, it takes about an hour per axle to replace. It could use new paint, but its tough to justify the cost. But....at 20 years old and 250k,....when you step on the gas, it jumps. When you're on the highway, you can take it to 80 mph without any vibration or shuddering. There is no play in the wheel, it feels like a new car when changing lanes or cornering. There is no roll when you take a corner faster than you should. We've since bought an 08 Corolla and the driving feel is night and day. The Corolla has that econo car feel.. light, like its going to be blown off the highway. The Neon feels like it grips the road.

 on 07/02/17 11:16 AM (PDT),Dev R. ,2005 Dodge Neon Sedan SXT 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),'05 Dodge Neon SXT Automatic," Owned the car for 1,000 miles as of review over a total of 4 months and has a total of 171,000 miles as of writing this. Previous owner had to swap in another transmission because the old one lost a gear (4th gear in these cars are pretty weak, so be wary of stomping the gas while in it). Interior can be very noisy and rattle a bunch, mostly because of the age of the car and it being a budget car that's a decade old, and looking like something from the 90s on the inside. When it comes to exterior, though, the car looks fairly modern-ish. Parts are cheap, too, so that's nice. The engines these little Neons have are almost bulletproof, so if you like driving fast and fun then it shouldn't let you down. Off the lot back in the day these made 130 horsepower and about the same number in Ib-feet of torque. Pretty zippy in the first few gears but 4th gear is such a dog (it's an overdrive gear so that explains why). It might be slow, but it's pretty fun to drive. Got a custom exhaust on mine that sounds deep and rumbly, not something that sounds like a weedwacker flying down the street. You can usually pick these cars up for $2,500 and less, but keep in mind the mileage and if the transmission has been replaced or not. A high mile Neon (150k+) with a rebuilt or replaced transmission could last you longer than something with ~120k and the original transmission. The manual option for these cars last a lot longer than the auto, but they can be tricky to find these days.",3

I think only the original owner, can give a proper review of a vehicle.  Buying ""any"" vehicle used, is a crap shoot....you may get lucky...or not.Observing and talking with many people, over my 50 years of driving, I can say, that without a doubt, many folks abuse their vehicles.  This can be done by the way they drive, or through maintenance, or both.I broke the car in for the first 1,000 miles by varying my speed and rpm.  I warm the car up for 15 seconds...to a full minute, depending on temperature.  I shift at 2000 to 2200 rpm until the car is fully warmed up(about 10 min.).I change the oil and filter myself, every 3,000 miles, with regular 5w20 oil.   The car has 60,210 miles on the clock as of today, with original everything.  No issues whatsoever.....none.  Everything works on the car.   I own several vehicles, accounting for the low mileage on this one.The best fuel mileage I attained so far, was 40mpg on a long trip.  From the Costco in south Carson City, Nevada, to Douglas County Oregon, on one tank.    Open road speeds were 65-70 mph.The car uses about a quarter of a quart of oil between oil changes....so I never add any in between.  I've had it to 100 mph and it was taching about 4,000 rpm and it had a lot more left.Overall, a great buy for $9999 out the door ....and a great car for the money.  Thanks Dodge!",4

The car handles great, fairly comfortable for a small car, and is fun to drive. Sure it could use more power, but it's way more than adequate. One thing though, is the in town mileage for this car is pretty low. I average 23 MPG in town. But on the highway, especially on our vacation trips, we hit 37 MPG regularly.

I expected about 29 to 30 mpg given the EPA ratings but only got about 26 on the first take.  It seems to have gained about 1 mpg every tank until it hit about 29.5 mpg.  The performance is quite acceptable given the power of the engine although the transmission can shift oddly at slow speeds.  I drove a manual for years so the behavior may be normal.  My only complaints are some unattractive black styrofoam under the steering wheel column in the dash.  It is visible and identifiable as styrofoam.

I am interested in seing what a stage 2 mopar package is going to do for me. Since I live in CO, I'm dreading the winter w/o AWD. However, when you let the horses loose on the 2.4L turbod engine from the on-ramp of I-25 (which is 75MPH) there is no differance of feeling from an SRT4 and an STI. the regular WRX actually feels slower!

I remember prototype turbocharged Neon's that were in Car and Driver that must have evolved in to the SRT-4.  I bought this car after a friend of mine took me for a ride in his red SRT- 4.  I went to the dealer 1 week later and got the Orange Blast w/ACR package.  I was not really crazy about the color, but it has grown on me so far.  So far, build quality, performance, and overall enjoyment has made this purchase one of my favorite cars ever.

I don't see how Chrysler could make and sell a car like this but then Viper and Prowler come to mind.  Simply put, this is a performance bargain!  The car isn't for everyone.  You must appreciate high performance and a taste for the daring because the ride is a bit on the harsh side.  It is designed to be high performance and everything about the car from the stance, engine sounds, to the look, feel and ride remind you of what it is.  This is not a car for first time drivers or people with bad backs. It can be driven daily with ease but it is truly at home being raced at a track.",4.375

It's fast and it does not drive the way you think a Neon does. It handles much sturdier than you think possible and can provide thrilling acceleration.

The seats are amazing, and your body has no idea the car is cornering hard other than the visual references that are coming through the windscreen.

First let me say this car is seriously fast.  The suspension is tight which makes handling incredible but it has a downside, when you hit a bump or hole your teeth are almost jarred out of your mouth. The shifting from the five speed manaul trans is smooth for the price. Braking is strong its amazing how short a distance you can stop in.  The fin in the back I don't like I call it the park bench and I'm seriously thinking about removing it.

So in 2003 I decided to retire that great baby to the purple heart and buy a used Dodge. Price was very good. After getting the shift solenoid seal fixed under warranty and pan gasket (within 1 month of buying so repair was free) have had no problems. Ride is smooth and corners well with HD suspension. Has great power. Mileage is better than advertised, with cruise and sensible driving can get 28 mpg on hwy. Great room and flexible too. Is very easy on tires and brakes. I have the 3.3 L which is a plus. Paint and exterior are very durable. Paid $11K in 2003 w/26000 on.",4.75

It's 3.8L engine took a little less gas then Windstar, and it's quite powerful too. I didn't know that when the car stays a couple weeks outside and brakes get rusty - you have to take the wheel off and smake the drums with the hammer, so I ended up replacing tire, brakes and wheel.

Even the dog can ride between the two front seats.  People deride the Caravan as for soccer moms.  I say it's ten times more macho and practical in real life than an SUV.

 on 09/13/17 13:27 PM (PDT),Bill ,2002 Dodge Caravan Minivan eC Fwd 4dr Minivan (2.4L 4cyl 4A),My best vehicle ever," If you don't take care of your Dodge eC Caravan you may not have the luck I've had, but for the money I spent this is my best car in 52 years of driving. I bought the van new on December 31, 2001, for $16,600 (if I remember correctly). The Dodge new-car discount/rebate of about $600 did not apply, but in almost 16 years with it I've probably saved $2000 in gasoline at 28-32 highway-miles per gallon over what I would have spent on a 6-cylinder model. I use it only for vacation and business trips, sleeping in the back of the van with the seats removed, and I've probably also saved close to $20,000 on motels. I regret not having cruise control, but in the eastern U.S. cruise is not as efficient as it used to be because there is so much traffic. Until ethanol became ubiquitous in gasoline I was consistently getting 31 to 32 mpg, but with ethanol that drops to 28 most of the time (a 16-percent drop in fuel efficiency for a 10-percent infusion of corn liquor--not the most environmentally sound decision, and decidedly counter-productive in the quest for energy independence). On the rare occasions when I've run through a tank of gas in local traffic the mileage has been about 23 to 24 mpg. I've followed the maintenance manual religiously, changing the oil every 4000 miles until I switched to synthetic, and now I let it go 6000, but I've had no emergency repairs to make. Because I let it sit through the winter I had a problem with mice hibernating in the ventilation system, but that's no fault of the car. The only other trouble I ever had was getting the steering wheel to unlock when I parked on a precipitous hill, but with a little manhandling I was able to get it to release enough to pull into drive and go on my way. I have no rust issues because I never drive it in the winter, save for one 600-mile trek through a freak October snowstorm. Despite having only summer tires (albeit brand-new ones) I plugged right along with my front-wheel drive through that heavy, wet snowfall while trailer trucks and SUVs were off the road on both sides. Speaking of tires, I'm only on my second set, and as of today (September 13, 2017) the van has 126,000 miles on it. Next week it goes in to get the timing belt replaced: I wasn't sure until calling my mechanic today that it had a timing belt instead of a timing chain, and I don't think the manual mentioned that; at least the maintenance schedule didn't say anything about it. I've babied the van from Day One, and no children have been allowed to trash it, or abuse the doors, so perhaps your experience may vary, but as for me I regret that there is no new eC model available to replace this one when (and if) it dies.",5

It has the autostick automatic transmission which is very nice on mountain roads as you can downshift just like a manual transmission to save the brakes. I have changed the transmission fluid every 30k miles as recommended and the engine oil every 3500-5000 miles and still doesn't use a drop between changes.

The $200 optional clear coat paint job began fading and peeling within 3 years and now looks like crap. The headlight lenses have turned milky white. Felt headliner falling down in a dozen areas.

In the first year, my hood was permanently indented from my oldest son leaning up against it. Also, the air conditioner had to be replaced within two years.

It's been an excellent van.  Our Grand Caravan SE has the quad seat option, so it's very comfortable for long-distance driving. The AC is very effective, even in high-90s heat, which we have a lot of in Tennessee. The rear air, if anything, is too effective, as we often hear complaints that it's too cold in the back. Hauling capability is a big plus too, with the removable rear seats. A 4x8 sheet of plywood will lie down in the back, not to mention smaller items.  I've tried to keep up with regular maintenance in accordance with the owner's manual. I think it's paid off. ",4.125

It didn't hit home that I had purchased an unreliable car until the basic factory warranty ran out. Things that have never gone bad on my other cars went bad on this Caravan. Over the past 12 months, I've spent over $2000 to repair the A/C alone.  My experience with this Caravan will be the last. This is my fifth Chrysler product but no more.
